The updated platform enables IT organizations to more easily procure and provision software and computing resources from multiple cloud services providers and other suppliers—all from a single, easy-to-navigate dashboard.</p>\n<p>Organizations can capitalize on the choice and agility that the cloud provides, without sacrificing control or abandoning existing investments. Cloud brokerage enables them to successfully balance the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/yin-yang-cloud-computing-traditional-brokerage-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">yin and yang of cloud computing and traditional IT</a>. The results are reduced risk, increased speed and agility and lower operating costs.</p>\n<p>With IBM Cloud Brokerage, IT can aid in the selection of the right cloud offerings by giving users access to cloud brokerage decision analytic tools. These tools compare the capability, performance, and price differences between providers, allowing users to make an informed choice and allowing organizations to balance user flexibility with appropriate controls and governance.</p>\n<h3><strong>Stronger capabilities</strong></h3>\n<p>The latest update to IBM Cloud Brokerage builds on the current robust set of capabilities. Highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Platform hardening and stabilization with improved VM operations and front-node scalability, deployment validation and test automation as well as tools to simplify the provider onboarding process</li>\n<li>Enhanced data encryption for both data at rest and data in motion and password compliance for improved security</li>\n<li>Enhanced support for Microsoft ARM Azure provisioning, automated billing and screening API</li>\n<li>Enhanced screen-and-compare functions to enable custom questions and weighted factors to help make recommendations</li>\n<li>Expansion to enable additional service provider support, including integration with IBM Cloud Orchestrator</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Enhancing a robust feature set </strong></h3>\n<p>These new features enhance existing IBM Cloud Brokerage capabilities. Its IT as a Service Catalog comes preloaded with public cloud providers and the APIs required to keep the pricing up-to-date. Users can add any existing on- or off-premise solution, creating a single, dynamic marketplace for all IT services. Within its catalog, IT administrators can easily add vendor-specific contract terms and pricing rules, giving an accurate view of current and project costs.</p>\n<p>Using these features allows IT to standardize and automate the entire IT value chain into three simpler phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plan: assess, compare, and design</li>\n<li>Buy: source, procure, and deliver</li>\n<li>Manage: govern, bill, and analyze</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, the new features extend existing capabilities of IBM Cloud Brokerage. CIOs and CTOs can transform their IT organizations and deliver a unified, compliant IT consumption and delivery experience for all users.</p>\n<p>To learn more about IBM Cloud Brokerage, visit <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/cloudbrokerage\" target=\"_blank\">this website</a>.

Our network operations team are going to like this.” A systems manager I recently met in the UK made these positive comments regarding the newly-released Network Device Dashboard, part of the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/it-operations-management/us/en-us\">IBM Netcool Operations Insight</a> (NOI) offering. This new device-centric dashboard presents a view of all relevant device data to enable quick resolution of network issues.</p>\n<p>The Network Device Dashboard aims to empower the network operations manager to deliver a better network service. It was designed specifically with network operations use cases. Its integrated tooling can better manage all network operations, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership. The dashboard also features the network event, topology and performance capabilities. And it is backed up by insightful and efficient analytics that enable operations support personnel to deliver a reliable network service to the company.</p>\n<p>The Network Device Dashboard delivers rapid network performance problem resolution. Here’s how it works.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 1:  Identify a network incident</strong></h3>\n<p>How will you know about issues affecting your network? The dashboard’s Netcool analytical capability first reduces chaotic event storms to manageable incidents. <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCVHB\" target=\"_blank\">Network Performance Insight</a> plays a key role in this step, especially in identifying performance related anomalies. It detects and alerts performance threshold violations in real-time. It configurable options helps you avoid false alerts.</p>\n<p>From the specific device-related incident, operations personnel can launch the Network Device Dashboard to facilitate further investigation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-39179\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard-300x115.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard-300x115.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard-768x295.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard.png 1005w\" alt=\"ibm-netcool-operations-insight-network--dashboard\" width=\"600\" height=\"230\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Step 2:  Isolate a network performance issue</strong></h3>\n<p>For performance-related anomalies, the Network Device Dashboard can give you an integrated view of related events, topology and device-specific performance metrics. To isolate problems, you first need to look at the network topology view that shows the device outage and its impact on neighboring devices. By default, the adjacent widget highlights specific performance metric threshold violations. You can view recent variations in this performance metric value to help understand the problem and gain greater insight into the overall device behavior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM%E2%80%99s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-39182\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM%E2%80%99s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map-300x140.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM’s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map-300x140.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM’s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map-768x358.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM’s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map-1024x478.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM’s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map.png 1042w\" alt=\"of-ibms-netcool-operations-insight-network-device-dashboard-map\" width=\"600\" height=\"280\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Resolve the issue</strong></h3>\n<p>The final step in resolving performance related issues is to get insight into traffic related issues on device interfaces. The Network Device Dashboard automatically highlights violating interfaces; operators can easily assess the worst interface specific metrics on key network links. They can then gain insight into the applications consuming the link bandwidth by launching the Performance Insight flow capability.</p>\n<p>We’re excited about our new integrated Netcool Operations Insight performance capabilities and how they can help our clients.

Further enhancements have been made to analytics that assess seasonality, thereby providing more insight into important, higher-priority anomalies. Additionally, faster time to value is achieved by providing users with earlier feedback on cognitive insights gained. These enhancements further strengthen the capability of Operations Analytics Predictive Insights Managed to enable proactive operations.</p>\n<p><b>Operations Analytics Log Analysis Managed</b></p>\n<p>As with Operations Analytics Predictive Insights Managed, Operations Analytics Log Analysis Managed also focuses on reducing mean-time-to-repair for operations and the provision of long-term IT operational data storage for historic visibility.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid search is achieved across terabytes of structured and unstructured operational data.</li>\n<li>Insights, through text analytics accompanied by domain specific visualizations and expert advice, are also provided.</li>\n<li>Operational data can be stored and retrieved for historical analysis using the optional integration with supported Hadoop distributions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Extended with Aggregated Search for greater visibility</b></p>\n<p>Operations Analytics Log Analysis Managed V1.3.5 enables aggregations on ingested IT operational data. In this way, worldwide operations can decide which operational data to aggregate globally. This function builds on the existing capability of Operations Analytics Log Analysis to provide historic visibility, empowering your organization with the breadth of visibility required for its global operations. For example, using log data, operations can aggregate counts of key service quality indicators at each data center and then gain global visibility on the service quality worldwide.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/4/897/ENUS216-034/index.html&amp;lang=en\">Learn more</a></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/10/ibm-operations-analytics-updates-bring-global-visibility-and-new-data-insights-analytic-value-proactive-operations/","date":"2016-10-04T12:00:10","modified":"2016-12-15T11:05:51","format":"standard","slug":"ibm-operations-analytics-updates-bring-global-visibility-and-new-data-insights-analytic-value-proactive-operations","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32171","excerpt":"<p>If you need visibility into you company&#8217;s global deployments, you&#8217;ll want to hear about the latest updates we&#8217;ve made to our operations analytics tool set.

It seems like a long time ago, but it was just 12 short months ago in Portland, Oregon.</p>\n<p>OSCON 2015 was especially important for IBM: not only did we return in a <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/44737\" target=\"_blank\">keynote speaking role</a>, but we announced a brand new initiative that would help incubate exciting new open source projects. A July 22 <a href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47362.wss\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> highlighted the developerWorks Open launch and generated a lot of coverage in publications including <em><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-open-sources-50-enterprise-apps-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">ZDNet</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.itworld.com/article/2951595/ibm-moves-open-source-business-software-to-the-cloud.html\" target=\"_blank\">ITWorld</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2951482/cloud-development/ibm-woos-cloud-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\">CIO</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Was this announcement news? You bet. But was it completely new? Well, yes and no.</p>\n<h2>Evolution of IBM open source</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been developing enterprise software for a while, you might remember IBM alphaWorks. Way back in August 1996, IBM started a customized effort to share binary executable programs with the outside world. This effort was branded alphaWorks, a special initiative focused on sharing emerging software, which to that point been kept behind the IBM firewall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/alphaworkslogo.gif\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-34884\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-34884\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/alphaworkslogo.gif\" alt=\"alphaworkslogo\" width=\"314\" height=\"75\" /></a>The alphaWorks site quickly became a popular destination on <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">developerWorks</a>, IBM’s software developer web portal. The new site was expanded to include a variety of software project types and soon earned a great reputation, becoming viewed as a “merit badge” for IBMers writing innovative code to share with the outside world.</p>\n<p>With the rise of open source development tooling and repo projects such as <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Git</a> in 2005 and <a href=\"https://github.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> in 2008, the need for alphaWorks began to fade, and the name was effectively sunset around 2010. Over the last five years, the number of <a href=\"http://ibm.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM repos on GitHub</a> has grown rapidly, and today that number is at or near one thousand.</p>\n<p>So with that volume of IBM open source code already on GitHub, what is the role of developerWorks Open?</p>\n<h2>Building communities, connecting innovators</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/developerWorks-Open2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-34886\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-34886\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/developerWorks-Open2.png\" alt=\"developerWorks-Open2\" width=\"200\" height=\"79\" /></a>IBM is more committed than ever to open source software, and developerWorks Open highlights some of the newest, most innovative, high-potential projects from IBM developers. Much more than just an index of projects, dWO features blogs, videos, and personal developer stories so that users can better understand the people <em>behind</em> the projects. We provide community links, Slack channels, and connection points to help you explore each project and get to know the people who are working on them. We also provide project leaders with best practice guidance, helping ensure that their project has a chance to flourish and grow.</p>\n<p>We feature all kinds of projects, from big, enterprise-level tools and platforms to small, boutique functions and apps. If it shows promise, we’re going to help it grow.</p>\n<p>A great example of a project that launched on dW Open and subsequently graduated is <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/ibm-open-blockchain/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Blockchain</a>, which has now become part of <a href=\"https://www.hyperledger.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperledger</a>, a collaborative project of the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger is a distributed transaction processing initiative supported by multiple organizations to advance features associated with distributed ledgers. Other developerWorks projects currently incubating include <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/node-red/\" target=\"_blank\">Node-RED</a>, a tool for wiring together the Internet of Things; <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/openwhisk/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenWhisk</a>, a new event-driven platform for serverless computing; and <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/amalgam8/\" target=\"_blank\">Amalgam8</a>, a platform to simplify the integration tasks needed for polyglot microservices.</p>\n<h2>The future is open</h2>\n<p>If you like open source software, you’ll find something to capture your imagination on developerWorks Open. Whether you’re an open source newbie or veteran, check out our <a href=\"https://www.developer.ibm.com/open/projects\" target=\"_blank\">Projects page</a> and browse among the dozens of projects that we’ve featured over the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>You can also stay connected by following us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IBMdwOpen\" target=\"_blank\">@IBMdWOpen</a> — like, retweet, or just let us know what you think.

They want to extend their existing WebSphere systems of record, differentiate new on-cloud WebSphere Liberty applications, or in other cases, take advantage of new cloud and Bluemix® services within their existing WebSphere systems of record. This can enable them to quickly enhance those applications with new, cloud-based added value. The WebSphere Connect strategy quickly makes the promises of hybrid a reality for WebSphere Application Server clients.</p>\n<p>The drive to hybrid WebSphere implementations created a need for a simplified, cloud-friendly and term-subscription type of licensing. To satisfy this requirement, the Virtual Processor Core (VPC) is a simplified license metric that is sold as a monthly license charge and is offered for WebSphere Application Server. VPC is a simple metric that applies to on-premise deployments and also on on-cloud deployments. It makes it easier to transition between hybrid deployment options.</p>\n<p>The WebSphere Application Server editions that offer the new VPC monthly metric include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WebSphere Family Edition</li>\n<li>WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment</li>\n<li>WebSphere Application Server</li>\n<li>WebSphere Application Server Liberty Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All current versions and releases of these WebSphere Application Server editions are eligible for the VPC metric.</p>\n<p>The pricing metrics that are available for the perpetual licensing options of WebSphere Application Server, remain unchanged by this announcement.</p>\n<p>With WebSphere and VPC monthly pricing, clients pay for what they need on a term and subscription basis. They can easily optimize application deployment between on-premises and the on-cloud deployments of their choice. A VPC is a processor core in an unpartitioned physical server, or a virtual core that is assigned to a virtual server. Clients must obtain entitlement for each VPC that is available to WebSphere. The counting rules are simple. Basically, if clients have a virtual core available to their WebSphere Application Server, they license a VPC for it regardless of whether they are on-premises or in the cloud. In cases where clients know how many physical cores that are being used, they license the lesser of the number of virtual cores or physical cores.</p>\n<p><b>VPC counting examples</b></p>\n<p><i>Example 1</i></p>\n<p>In a cloud deployment, the client:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buys a Virtual Cloud Server as a Service on a internal private cloud or public cloud service provider, such as SoftLayer®, Azure, or Amazon.</li>\n<li>Purchases an 8-core Virtual CPU environment.</li>\n<li>Must license 8 VPCs for this environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>Example 2</i></p>\n<p>On-premises deployment that uses VMWare, the client:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploys multiple VMWare hosts to run WebSphere. The server is a 2 Socket server with 4 cores per socket. The total number of physical cores is 8.</li>\n<li>Runs 16 VMWare hosts running WebSphere on the server. The total number of virtual cores across the VMWare hosts is 16.</li>\n<li>As the hardware can be physically identified as a 8-core server, the client only pays for 8 VPCs and not 16. It is the lesser of the two numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While not required for use of VPC, the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#%21/wiki/IBM%20License%20Metric%20Tool/page/Determining%20the%20usage%20of%20Virtual%20Processor%20Cores%20%28VPC%29\" target=\"_blank\"> IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT)</a> can help clients determine their level of VPC usage.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/7/897/ENUS216-307/index.html&amp;lang=en&amp;request_locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a></strong></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/07/check-out-the-new-hybrid-cloud-monthly-pricing-options-for-was/","date":"2016-07-12T12:00:05","modified":"2016-12-16T04:23:51","format":"standard","slug":"check-out-the-new-hybrid-cloud-monthly-pricing-options-for-was","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32161","excerpt":"<p>More and more businesses deploy IBM® WebSphere® Application Server within a mixed hybrid environment of on-premises and on-cloud deployments.

Its location in this tech learning community for students, startups and established companies will deepen IBM’s roots in the city’s thriving tech scene, and build on IBM’s work with disruptive New York City companies such as Alpha Modus, an investment tech firm.</p>\n<p>“Ramping up more companies on Bluemix will be a significant addition to New York City’s tech economy, as it enables financial tech companies like us to innovate with APIs such as Watson,” said Prashant Bhuyan, cofounder and CEO of Alpha Modus. “Using Bluemix, we’ve been able to roll out transformational apps that leverage cognitive analytics with unbelievable time and efficiency –helping to shake up the way our clients invest in the markets.”</p>\n<p>Since 2014, IBM Cloud has partnered with the City of New York to power the city’s Digital.NYC platform, a hub for New York City’s rapidly growing startup economy. Currently, nearly 8,000 startups – over half of the city’s startup base<sup>2</sup> – are using Digital.NYC to connect and collaborate. Also in 2014, the company announced the opening of its Astor Place offices, which serves as the headquarters for both its Watson and Cloud businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Galvanize has been a great home and partner for IBM’s groundbreaking Bluemix Garage on our San Francisco campus, and we are excited to bring that partnership to New York City,” said Jim Deters, co-founder and CEO of Galvanize. “Having IBM’s Garage in New York City, within the Galvanize community, allows our strong network of developers and startups to leverage the power of the cloud and the expertise of IBM to competitively innovate products and apps in the growing fintech and blockchain spaces.”</p>\n<p>Located at 315 Hudson Street in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood, an area which in recent years has become a mecca for startups, the newest Garage will help spur innovation via:</p>\n<p><strong>Business Development</strong>: Combining enterprise expertise, agile methods, and IBM Design Thinking, a unique process to design, build and deploy, Garage consultants help clients to refine, iterate on and deliver a business idea into an app.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/06/check-out-our-new-bluemix-garage-in-nyc-for-cloud-developers/","date":"2016-06-28T12:00:53","modified":"2016-12-15T11:34:49","format":"standard","slug":"check-out-our-new-bluemix-garage-in-nyc-for-cloud-developers","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32247","excerpt":"<p>New York, NY &#8211; 28 Jun 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the opening of an IBM Bluemix Garage in New York City, which will help power the city’s growing concentration of developers, entrepreneurs, and fintech companies with cloud and blockchain.

Their response to me was that they simply did not see IBM in this space; neither a positive nor a negative view. It became quite clear that we needed to be a part of their community instead of on the outside trying to sell to them.</p>\n<p>We came up with the idea of the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/garage/\">IBM Bluemix Garages</a> from there: co-locate with incubators that have an established presence within the startup community while directly bringing modern application development practices and innovation solutions to clients.</p>\n<h2>IBM commitment to NYC<strong><br />\n</strong></h2>\n<p>Our most recent IBM Bluemix Garage opened today in New York City, specifically designed to help enterprises use Blockchain technology on the cloud. It’s co-located within <a href=\"http://www.galvanize.com/\">Galvanize’s</a> new campus in Soho. This is our seventh Garage, with others in San Francisco, London, Toronto, Nice, Tokyo and Singapore … with more to come.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6014\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garage-map-1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garage-map-1-300x158.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garage-map-1-768x404.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garage-map-1.png 844w\" alt=\"bluemix-garage-map\" width=\"650\" height=\"342\" /></p>\n<p>What we have found is that the Garages provide true melting pots for startups and enterprises, which help teams innovate faster using new technologies and methods. Yes, enterprises can learn to be as fast and customer-focused as startups. It’s a two-way street. Startups learn how to build apps and cloud services that meet the exacting demands of enterprise customers, which is a huge market. Plus, it is important to focus on the culture change of moving to the cloud.</p>\n<p>The promise of Blockchain innovation has the potential to take an already thriving NYC fintech scene to new heights. Our newest Bluemix Garage in this entrepreneurial, co-working NYC community will deepen IBM roots in the city’s thriving tech scene in finance, design and other industries, building on top of IBM work with disruptive New York companies such as <a href=\"http://alphamodus.com/\">Alpha Modus</a>, an investment tech firm.</p>\n<h2>An environment for innovation</h2>\n<p>If you have not been to an IBM Bluemix Garage, they are experience environments that harness face-to-face collaboration and offer clients a wide range of innovation disciplines.</p>\n<p>IBM Bluemix is the obvious cloud platform of choice in which the technology environment enables rapid innovation based on open standards and open source software. It offers more than 140 tools and services, spanning Blockchain, big data, mobile, Watson, analytics, integration, security and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>\n<p>Our IBM Bluemix Garage Method helps clients navigate the innovation process, merging a variety of disciplines, including IBM design thinking, lean startup, agile software development, and DevOps, a discipline that’s increasingly critical for enterprise IT departments</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qmm7wGZDc5c?feature=oembed\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The Garages focus on small projects. Then we run tests to ensure it is a successful idea and adopted by the users. Then we scale. By combining learning and doing, a team emerges with a transformational, new approach to innovation and their first application on IBM Bluemix.</p>\n<p>For instance, a major retailer dipped its toes in the water by building an app for its corporate communications team in just four weeks. The app uses Watson Tone Analyzer, among other capabilities, to evaluate the initial drafts of executive speeches to gauge whether they will be well received by target audiences. Its assessments guide adjustments.</p>\n<h2>Focus on people and culture</h2>\n<p>There’s a temptation to focus on technology as the be-all and end-all, but our Garage experiences have proven that when our clients focus on people and culture, they succeed. They put in place the right people with the right mindsets and skills, which promotes a culture of open collaboration and teaches a set of innovation methods.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6015\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garages-collage.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garages-collage-285x300.png 285w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garages-collage.png 606w\" alt=\"bluemix-garages-collage\" width=\"606\" height=\"638\" /></p>\n<p>When given a technology platform like IBM Bluemix that provides a wide range of choices, our clients can truly address the problems they’re trying to solve and to help the users they’re trying to serve at a pace they have never been able to before.</p>\n<p>The critical factors we’ve learned in our first two years of running the IBM Bluemix Garages is that talent and culture go hand-in-hand.

Alert Notification is an easy-to-use notification service that meets the increasing demand for agility and efficient collaboration among IT operations and DevOps team members who use multiple monitoring and management tools. IT staffs receive instant notification alerts for any issues in the IT operations environment, optimizing your business performance, increasing customer satisfaction and protecting revenue.</p>\n<p>Since Alert Notification is provided as a service, management and installation of the required infrastructure is handled by IBM, reducing your time-to-value and offering low-maintenance ownership.</p>\n<p>IBM Alert Notification was built from the ground up to help IT ops and DevOps teams who want to communicate effectively and efficiently to solve problems faster before they impact businesses and their customers.</p>\n<p>IBM Alert Notification allows IT ops and DevOps teams to save time and money by sending actionable alerts to the appropriate people or groups at the appropriate time using methods including email, SMS, voice, mobile apps or Slack (new!)</p>\n<p>No more missed communications about an IT event that needs immediate attention. And in the event that the alert notification is not acknowledged within the organization’s specified time period, the notification is escalated.</p>\n<p>The new scheduling feature makes Alert Notification even easier to use and takes into account the need for organizations to set up on-duty and on-call shifts. The process of scheduling is considered to be one of the most time-consuming tasks that prevent users from utilizing a notification tool. When designing the new scheduling feature, we collected input from all types of users to ensure that the experience was intuitive and required minimal steps to utilize. Users have the ability to customize or use out-of-the-box templates.</p>\n<p>Users can manually create shifts or they can use built -shift patterns to get their scheduling done faster. The new scheduling software is even smart enough to schedule users or groups by itself for weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>With the new scheduling feature you can be assured that you will have around-the clock-coverage and can be alerted to any gaps in coverage.</p>\n<p>And for users who want to be reminded when they are on duty or on call, IBM Alert Notification can do that for you too!</p>\n<p>With Alert Notification, you will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never miss your actionable critical alerts.</li>\n<li>Immediately route alerts to the right people.</li>\n<li>Speed alert responses with automated escalation policies.</li>\n<li>Schedule your coverage weeks in advance</li>\n<li>Notify your staff when they are on duty and on call</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explore countless benefits and take a look at the new capabilities of IBM Alert Notification on <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/alert-notification/us/en-us#product-header\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Marketplace.</a> We encourage you to see how easy IBM Alert Notification is to use with a 60-day trial.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/bringing-saas-ibm-alert-notification/","date":"2016-06-20T12:00:15","modified":"2016-12-15T11:31:26","format":"standard","slug":"bringing-saas-ibm-alert-notification","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32311","excerpt":"<p>We are excited to announce new capabilities along with the IBM Alert Notification SaaS offering that was first announced earlier this year.

a future in which a computer reduces the time and effort required to develop new drugs or saves lives with more accurate weather forecasting. Quantum computers find answers to complex sets of problems that today’s classical (non-quantum) computers are really bad at. Classical computers operate by sequentially manipulating “strings of bits” that can either be a “0” or a “1.”  Quantum computers operate using “qubits” which can be a “0,” “1” or both simultaneously. Quantum computers can solve problems faster because “qubits” exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing algorithms to complete their analyses in fewer steps than classical computers.</p>\n<p>In May, I was excited to see that IBM made quantum computing available to the public on the IBM Cloud platform. I was eager to increase my quantum computing knowledge, so I signed up for access. Since I really didn’t know anything about qubits, superposition, entanglement, gates, or quantum algorithms, I spent four hours completing the quantum computing tutorial available through the portal. Quantum computing is different than traditional computer science, so you have to be willing to “let go of what you know.” Quantum computing involves computation, so you should be prepared for a high-school math refresher as you take the tutorial.</p>\n<p>The portal has a quantum computing simulator called the “composer” that I used throughout the tutorial to try out the quantum computing concepts I was learning. The simulator’s user interface (shown below) looks a bit like sheet music. Each line represents a qubit. Quantum computer algorithms are created by “dragging and dropping” various logic gates onto lines and connecting them together. Just like classical computers have their “and” and “or” Boolean logic gates, quantum computers have “pauli operators,” “superposition” and “c-not” logic gates.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-5947 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer-1024x527.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer-300x155.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer-768x396.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer-1024x527.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer.png 1262w\" alt=\"QuantumComputer\" width=\"625\" height=\"322\" /></p>\n<p>After I finished writing my quantum computing program, I used the composer to simulate the program, visualize the results and debug a program logic mistake I’d made. Now, for the really exciting part: finally, with a working quantum program, I used the composer to run my program on the IBM “real” five-qubit quantum processor. The quantum simulator and processor produced identical results.</p>\n<p>Just like other cloud services, quantum computing is pay-per-use. Initially, my account was loaded with six “units” or credits. One run of my program costs between three and five units. IBM replenished my account the day after I used up my units so I could continue to explore quantum computing.</p>\n<p>Now it’s your turn to imagine what’s possible.

To assist enterprises to receive function and product maintenance more quickly, a major change in the IBM® Software Support Lifecycle Policy is introduced.</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, IBM adds a new policy, known as the continuous delivery (CD) support model, for eligible, on-premise IBM software products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/GIF/ALET/OP351112.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"378\" align=\"middle\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The new support model is implemented as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The CD support model allows eligible, on-premise IBM products to make new function available more frequently. It is understood that frequent releases of the model may not be suitable for all client application environments. In those cases, some IBM products may offer a Long Term Support Release (LTSR) option.</li>\n<li>An LTSR is supported for a longer period of time, to assist clients where frequent functional updates may not be practical and a longer term deployment is more suitable. IBM may elect to declare any CD update package an LTSR.</li>\n<li>Both new function and product maintenance will be made available in a single, easy-to-install CD update package.</li>\n<li>Clients should stay current with the installation of CD update and LTSR packages to obtain the latest product maintenance and new function. Product defect fixes and security updates are only available for the two, most current CD update packages and all active LTSRs. If required, individual product fixes can be made available between CD update packages for resolution of problems.</li>\n<li>CD update packages are delivered on the latest product release stream when the new product release becomes available.</li>\n<li>New functional updates are not available to previously released CD update packages and LTSRs.</li>\n<li>Support is available for all IBM components of a product until the product is withdrawn from support. IBM expects clients will upgrade to either the latest CD update package or LTSR in order to receive on-going security updates and defect fixes.</li>\n<li>Support extensions are available, for a minimum period of one year for an additional fee, following the effective support discontinuance date of the product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new Software Support Lifecycle Policy delivers a consistent and predictable availability of support. Clients will continue to receive the same world-class support and assistance that they are accustomed to from IBM. This support is included in the standard Software Subscription and Support (S&amp;S), Software Maintenance (SWM), or Monthly License Charge (MLC) charges for the eligible product.</p>\n<p>By maintaining a current S&amp;S, SWM, MLC, or SupportLine agreement, clients will receive the maximum value for their software products and can take advantage of the CD support model.</p>\n<p>With the CD support model, IBM will deliver product technical support for at least two years, which starts at the availability of a new product version or release. IBM will also offer an optional, fee-based support extension for at least one additional year. This model is referred to as a 2 plus 1 (2+1) policy. This is a significant change from the existing Standard (3+2) and Enhanced (5+3) IBM software support policies. The existing Standard and Enhanced policies are not impacted by this announcement and will continue to be available. By maintaining S&amp;S, SWM, or MLC on their IBM software, clients receive the maximum value of their software products and can take full advantage of technology upgrades and enhancements quickly, based on their business requirements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/9/897/ENUS216-269/index.html&amp;lang=en&amp;request_locale=en\">Learn more</a></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/05/announcing-continuous-delivery-support-model-options-for-ibm-software/","date":"2016-05-24T12:00:42","modified":"2016-12-16T04:26:37","format":"standard","slug":"announcing-continuous-delivery-support-model-options-for-ibm-software","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32347","excerpt":"<p>In the cognitive era of computing, enterprises embrace three historic technology shifts to enhance the business value that are provided their clients: Big data Cloud computing Combination of social and mobile At the same time, the pace of business model innovation continues to accelerate to drive an increasing need and pace for delivery of new [&hellip;]</p>\n","menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America/New_York","date_gmt":"2016-05-24T16:00:42","modified_tz":"America/New_York","modified_gmt":"2016-12-16T09:26:37","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32347","author":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/27","collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts","replies":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32347/comments","version-history":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32347/revisions"}},"featured_image":null,"terms":{"category":[{"ID":667,"name":"DevOps","slug":"devops","description":"","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":26,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/category/devops/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/667"}}}]}},{"ID":32351,"title":"IBM API Connect adds on-demand consulting to help clients unleash APIs","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":27,"username":"deepthimc","name":"deepthimc","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"deepthimc","slug":"deepthimc","URL":"","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aaa3ca991a7e6b088a8b0d19f4522919?s=96","description":"","registered":"2016-12-07T14:05:45+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/27","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/27/posts"}}},"content":"<p>API Connect for Bluemix Dedicated now delivers consulting options that include API Connect On Demand Consulting, which is a revolutionary, On Demand Consulting model from IBM.

Today, IBM also made a range of announcements spanning technology and business consulting to rapidly advance the use of distributed ledger technology across multiple industries:</p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li><strong>New blockchain services on the IBM Cloud:</strong> New blockchain services help create and manage blockchain networks to power a new class of distributed ledger applications. Developers can create digital assets and accompanying business logic to more securely and privately transfer assets among members of a permissioned blockchain test network. Using IBM’s new blockchain services available on Bluemix, developers can access fully integrated DevOps tools for creating, deploying, running and monitoring blockchain applications on the IBM Cloud. Blockchain applications can also be deployed on IBM z Systems, enabling an additional level of security, availability and performance for handling sensitive and regulated data. Blockchain applications can access existing transactions on distributed servers and z Systems through APIs to support new payment, settlement, supply chain and business processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li><strong>Enabling Internet of Things (IoT) data on blockchain:</strong> Using its Watson IoT Platform, IBM will make it possible for information from devices such as RFID-based locations, barcode-scan events, or device-reported data to be used with IBM’s Blockchain. Devices will be able to communicate to blockchain-based ledgers to update or validate smart contracts. For example, as an IoT-connected package moves along multiple distribution points, the package location and temperature information could be updated on a blockchain. This allows all parties to share information and status of the package as it moves among multiple parties to ensure the terms of a contract are met.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li><strong> IBM Garages for blockchain app design and implementation: </strong>To help accelerate the design and development of blockchain applications, IBM Garages will open in London, New York, Singapore and Tokyo to enable IBM experts to collaborate with developers on the design and implementation of blockchain for business. IBM Global Business Services will also expand its blockchain consulting practice for clients in banking and financial services and logistics. IBM Interactive Experience (IBM iX), the largest global digital agency, will also engage clients to co-design new use cases for blockchain in more than 25 IBM Studios around the globe.</li>\n</ul>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/04/why-ibm-just-launched-secure-blockchain-services/","date":"2016-04-29T12:00:20","modified":"2016-12-15T11:34:35","format":"standard","slug":"why-ibm-just-launched-secure-blockchain-services","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32281","excerpt":"<p>ARMONK, N.Y. &#8211; 16 Feb 2016: To help developers quickly begin exploring the use of blockchain in the enterprise, IBM (NYSE: IBM) has made nearly 44,000 lines of code available to the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project to help developers easily build secure distributed ledgers that can be used to exchange most anything of [&hellip;]</p>\n","menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America/New_York","date_gmt":"2016-04-29T16:00:20","modified_tz":"America/New_York","modified_gmt":"2016-12-15T16:34:35","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32281","author":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/21","collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts","replies":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32281/comments","version-history":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32281/revisions"}},"featured_image":null,"terms":{"category":[{"ID":669,"name":"Blockchain","slug":"blockchain","description":"","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":5,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/category/blockchain/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/669"}}}]}},{"ID":32315,"title":"Connect and automate your business with IBM App Connect","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":21,"username":"debadat1","name":"Debarati Datta","first_name":"Debarati","last_name":"Datta","nickname":"debadat1","slug":"debadat1","URL":"","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/abb2f4b81e84dd828e7dc6af9da8dcf0?s=96","description":"","registered":"2016-12-07T13:55:43+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/21","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/21/posts"}}},"content":"<h2>We’re living through an app explosion</h2>\n<p>Think about all of the applications lines of business rely on to get their work done: Customer relationship management (CRM) apps, marketing automation apps, social apps, sales and HR apps and more!

For example, last year the marketing technology landscape included more than 2000 vendors with tools across more than 40 categories.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5326 size-full\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan1.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan1.jpg 600w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan1-300x225.jpg 300w\" alt=\"app explosion graphic demonstrating the need for ibm app connect\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></p>\n<p>Organizations likely rely on hundreds or thousands of apps for their workers. Modern frameworks, patterns, and methodologies like microservices and APIs mean modern applications are more lightweight and more specialized. The app landscape has changed forever.</p>\n<p>The problem is, business professionals are often working harder getting their apps to work together than on delivering client value.</p>\n<p>A number of different apps need to work together to have an efficient workflow, but those apps don’t really talk to each other. They aren’t working together as a team the way teams are supposed to work. They don’t have the situational awareness to share data when required or to execute the right action at the right time. They aren’t working intelligently. People are spending far too much time on routine and manual tasks to get all of their apps working together instead of thinking, being creative, and delivering value to clients. For example, according to a recent <a href=\"http://ibm.co/1StYGAe\" target=\"_blank\">Hubspot survey</a>, the average marketer spends a third of their time completing repetitive tasks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5328\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2.jpg 2196w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2-768x536.jpg 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2-1024x714.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"graphic demonstrating time spent on routine tasks from hubspot\" width=\"600\" height=\"419\" /></a></p>\n<p>A lot of tools lines of business use are probably cloud-based, but a lot of systems are behind the company firewall. If you’re an IT professional, you’re constantly battered with requests to get access to data in systems behind the firewall. If you’re a line-of-business user like a digital marketer, you are dependent on IT to get work done, and IT has to manage all of the requests that come their way and manage all the applications used both in the cloud and on premises.</p>\n<p><strong>How do we get our tools to work better together?</strong></p>\n<p>How do we get more value out of our data by maintaining consistency across the set of tools we use everyday? How do we automate tedious, routine tasks so we can spend more time on creating value for our company? As the sophistication of our roles increases, are we concerned about adopting yet another tool because we don’t know whether or not it will talk to our existing systems and tools?</p>\n<p><strong>To survive in this app landscape, we need a solution that empowers us</strong></p>\n<p>We need a solution that lets us become an agent of change in our organizations–delivering value on the spot as we recognize opportunities to instrument how our applications work together to deliver greater business value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ibm.co/1WemYRh\" target=\"_blank\">IBM App Connect</a> is a new solution announced at InterConnect 2016.

To maintain support, clients on this continuous delivery model will need to keep their IBM MQ environment up-to-date with the continuous delivery of modification levels rather than the long term support fixpacks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/3/897/ENUS216-153/index.html&amp;lang=en&amp;request_locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more.</a></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/04/announcing-enhancements-to-ibm-mq-that-help-you-master-messaging/","date":"2016-04-19T12:00:45","modified":"2016-12-16T04:39:07","format":"standard","slug":"announcing-enhancements-to-ibm-mq-that-help-you-master-messaging","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32085","excerpt":"<p>IBM MQ V9.0 for multiplatforms is a robust and secure messaging middleware offeringthat allows applications, systems, services, and files to exchange data rapidly and reliably.

The answer was a resounding yes – since its launch on March 9, the app has been downloaded approximately 75,000 times and the included consent form has been filled out by 40,000 participants so far.</em></p>\n<p><em>Stanford Medicine’s <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/myheartcounts.html\">MyHeart Counts</a> was one of five demonstration apps involved in Apple’s launch of its <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2015/04/apples-medical-checkup-researchkit-adds-momentum-around-securely-storing-medical-data-in-the-cloud/\">Research Kit</a>, designed to further medical research by leveraging mobile and wearable devices for input and storing medical information in the cloud, where researchers can share findings. </em><strong>Thoughts on Cloud</strong><em> talked with Dr. Alan Yeung, MD, the Li Ka Shing Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford, about how the convenience of mobile devices and ubiquity of cloud storage could change the face of medical research. </em></p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud:</strong> With Stanford’s heart-health study, you’ve seen record involvement in a very short amount of time. Did this surprise you?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeung:</strong> Generally when you do clinical research you may get one in five or one in 10 people to sign the consent form, because the form is so long.  So our first question was, can consent be obtained on a device? It had never been done before.</p>\n<p>We were one of five demonstration apps that Apple launched to show that this type of research is possible and feasible, because in the beginning no one knows for sure if anyone would open up these kinds of apps and download them. The other four apps (studying breast cancer, Parkinson’s, asthma, and diabetes) are targeted toward people with the disease, but our app is targeted at everybody. It checks cardiovascular health to see if we can measure physical activity or lack of physical activity, how it relates to heart health, and [the effects of] modifying behavior. So the first thing we are doing is trying to measure some baselines with people – are they willing to sign a consent form, go through basic questionnaires, and enter some data? The answer is yes – people are willing to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud:</strong> <strong>How are you storing the data? Are there concerns about privacy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yeung:</strong> We’re being very careful. With Apple’s ResearchKit all the data sits on the survey subject’s phone, and they can choose to turn it off any time. We only upload the identified data from their phone (at which point subjects’ names are removed and replaced by random code to protect privacy) and we store it on a secure server run by Sage Bionetworks, so we never really see the data from the people.</p>\n<p>Right now Sage is the common ground for everybody to share data, they have that capability so they’re [storing data] for everyone. If an institution doesn’t have the back end they can continue to use Sage, but those that have enough apps and research will want to have their own back end and  then upload the analysis results to Sage, because it will be faster.</p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud: Does Stanford Medicine have the infrastructure to store survey data?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yeung:</strong> We didn’t have it when we started this app; there are legal issues, security issues, privacy issues. We are building the capability and hopefully we’ll be able to get data from subjects’ phones, analyze it and send the results to Sage.</p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud:</strong> In addition to the issues around getting your own infrastructure set up to store data, what kind of challenges does this type of medical research face?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeung:</strong> We don’t have all the legal issues resolves for an international launch, there are issues with data crossing borders. So for now we are limited to the US.</p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud:</strong> <strong>How has your app demonstrated that medical research can be advanced by this type of study?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yeung: </strong>One of the advancements in research capabilities it brings is providing a tool for anyone who wants to build an (electronic) consent form – the tools are now there for any group to get consent using a mobile device. That’s really helpful to know.</p>\n<p>Right now we are downloading the data to do analysis and establish baselines. In just a little less than two months we have data on a large number of patients, and hopefully we can write a paper in the next couple of weeks. I call that speed unknown to mankind when it comes to clinical research, because clinical research always has a long lead time and by the time something is published, something else has come up. Here you can do something relatively rough – some of the questions in our study aren’t deep, but they’re done on a large number of patients so you get generalized observations. And with this type of study you can reach people all over the US in a very short amount of time.</p>\n<p>This type of research is so much faster, so you get a good sense of what the baseline is, then you can do more detailed, traditional research. So it will replace certain types of research, but it’s not going to replace all types of research. It’s a new way to get a lot of information quickly.<br />\n<img src=\"https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/conv/?adv=z8lo6ws&amp;ct=0:z73koya&amp;fmt=3\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/04/race-for-the-cure-mobile-devices-and-cloud-storage-speed-medical-research/","date":"2016-04-04T12:00:26","modified":"2016-12-16T05:04:03","format":"standard","slug":"race-cure-mobile-devices-cloud-storage-speed-medical-research","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32969","excerpt":"<p>When the Stanford University School of Medicine launched a cardiovascular study that uses an iPhone app to collect data from subjects and stores information in the cloud, the first question researchers were looking to answer was whether people would use it.

Under the leadership of Michael Fraenkel, IBM’s distinguished engineer in Cloud Foundry, we’ve created a space where local IBM Cloud developers who are experts in Cloud Foundry are training fellow software developers—regardless of company or affiliation—to become dedicated “committers” for the Cloud Foundry project.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5488\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dojo-1-300x225.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dojo-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dojo-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dojo-1-1024x768.jpeg 1024w\" alt=\"Dojo 1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></p>\n<p>Why is this a big deal?</p>\n<p>When developers help developers, it translates to accelerated innovation. This new learning space serves as a training ground for aspiring Cloud Foundry developers, while simultaneously driving new innovation and continuous improvement to Cloud Foundry open source projects. The entire open source developer ecosystem—adopters and contributors alike—can benefit from a growing base of skilled Cloud Foundry developers and the increased pace of innovation thanks to shared code.</p>\n<p>Additionally, because Cloud Foundry is at the core of IBM’s cloud platform, <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/\">Bluemix</a> has rapidly grown to become the largest public Cloud Foundry deployment in the world. It features more than 140 tools and services spanning areas like big data, mobile, Watson, analytics, integration, DevOps, security and the Internet of Things and draws more than 20,000 new developers per week who are creating more than 120,000 apps every month. The dojo increases the pace of innovation on the Bluemix platform, which benefits the growing community of developers on IBM Cloud.</p>\n<p>The dojo also provides a unique environment that dramatically reduces the time it takes for coders to reach Cloud Foundry “committer” status. Students pair up for intense, hands-on training for only 6-12 weeks and graduates can take the skills they learned in the dojo and immediately put them to use within Cloud Foundry projects and their organizations.</p>\n<p>It’s not only a coup for IBM and Cloud Foundry. The RTP area will benefit from the project, too. Julie Terry, Special Projects Manager for The Research Triangle Park, explains why it’s such an important step forward for the area:</p>\n<p>“We’re really excited to have the IBM Cloud Foundry Dojo at The Frontier here in Research Triangle Park. When The Frontier opened a year ago, our team had hopes that it would become a convening point for all kinds of people with varied interests. Through our partnership with IBM, coders and cloud evangelists will have the opportunity to mingle with artists and nonprofit leaders. The best kind of change occurs when different minds start working together, and that’s exactly what we hope happens as the dojo continues to become an established part of The Frontier community.”</p>\n<p>I’ve been working with Cloud Foundry Foundation CEO Sam Ramji since the organization’s inception. In that time, I’ve watched Cloud Foundry become an indispensable platform for the developer, by the developer. It allows developers to use any language they want and deploy across many clouds. Sam Ramji explains why dojos are such an effective way to build a critical mass of software coders developing innovative applications on Cloud Foundry:</p>\n<p>“The dojo method provides a truly immersive approach to learning the process and methodology required to become a Cloud Foundry Committer. By ensuring developers are educated on continuous innovation and paired programming, the dojo helps ensure a culture and skills match for full-time committers to the project.”</p>\n<p>If you’re in the RTP area and want to attend our launch party, I encourage you to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rtp-cloud-foundry-dojo-launch-event-tickets-20974360878\">register and join us for this event</a>.

Well, after spending the past two days at the IBM InterConnect Conference in Las Vegas, hybrid cloud has been at the forefront of every conversation.</p>\n<p>Hybrid cloud has emerged as the cornerstone for digital transformation, enabling developers to up their ante by creating mobile, IoT and other client engagement applications that connect to enterprise data and services, delivering unique and compelling customer experiences without starting from scratch.  Sounds like a long shot with low odds? Well, it’s now easier than you think.</p>\n<p>IBM announced a new series of Connect Offerings for IBM Cloud to help businesses unlock the value of their existing applications, data and services by connecting them to and from the cloud.   In short, these new offerings fundamentally transform how you can extend your IT investments and capabilities with hybrid cloud.</p>\n<p>IBM’s entire software platform portfolio is now available on the cloud via public, private, or on-premises delivery models, with easy on-ramps to hybrid cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>Marie Wieck, General Manager of IBM Cloud Application Services said, “The power of cloud based applications is that you can easily represent both real time information and the collective knowledge on any topic. That’s always going to be a combination of newly created services and existing apps, many of which exist on-premises.”</p>\n<p>These new offerings allow clients to do just that, unlock the value of their billion dollar IT investments through a hybrid cloud approach, creating new cloud-native applications that connect to existing on-premises applications and data.</p>\n<p>At the core of IBM’s new offerings is WebSphere Connect, a set of hybrid cloud capabilities leveraging cloud services and APIs to enhance applications, whether cloud-native or on-premises.  These new capabilities allow developers to expose enterprise data and services as APIs, and connect to and from the cloud to enhance existing on-premises applications with innovative cloud services, like cognitive computing capabilities from IBM Watson and operational services providing performance insights.</p>\n<p>Now developers can leverage their existing skills to expose, create and connect applications leveraging IBM’s Bluemix cloud platform.  Ultimately, these capabilities help businesses optimize costs, reduce time to market and extend the value of critical enterprise data and services eliminating costly “rip and replace” strategies that are always a losing bet.</p>\n<p><strong>The API economy</strong></p>\n<p>Tied to any conversation about applications at InterConnect are APIs (“Application Programming Interfaces”).  APIs are a hot topic that has been discussed in detail throughout the conference and their influence on the emerging <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/middleware/integration/en-us/api-economy.html\">API economy</a>. Businesses of all sizes are seeing the benefits of monetizing APIs to capitalize on this economy by offering them as services through mobile, web and cloud channels creating new revenue sources and broadening their reach to new markets.</p>\n<p>APIs make it quick and cost-effective for businesses to create interfaces between back-end systems and front-end applications so new digital services can get to market faster. A part of the new Connect Offerings for IBM Cloud is API Connect, an end to end API lifecycle offering which allows any client to create, test, publish and manage APIs — making it easy to find, call, connect and consume APIs through cloud.  API Connect also enables automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance.  A first of its kind offering with powerful capabilities for both Developers and IT Operation management teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Application delivery</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong>Finally, making sure you can move your applications where they provide the most value for your business gives you the ultimate winning hand.  Delivering applications fast while maintaining a secure, scalable, high performance environment is the trick.  Hybrid cloud means that you need seamless portability across any environment and new capabilities from PureApplication make this even easier.  New Open Patterns beta, and Bluemix Local make automating workload portability easier by defining repeatable, dependable and secure patterns to achieve the flexibility to deploy where and when it works best for your business.</p>\n<p>As hybrid cloud adoption (another winning bet placed for the mention of “hybrid cloud”) continues to grow, organizations have a wealth of capabilities to unlock the value of their existing application investments while innovating on the cloud.  To learn more, read IBM’s recent <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49155.wss\">press announcement</a>.<strong><em><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you’re in attendance this week, be sure to network and share your experience at the conference using hashtags #IBMInterConnect, #WebSphere, #PureApp, or #IBMDevOps.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/02/easy-on-ramps-to-hybrid-cloud-are-the-best-bet-in-vegas/","date":"2016-02-25T12:00:05","modified":"2016-12-16T05:03:01","format":"standard","slug":"easy-ramps-hybrid-cloud-best-bet-vegas","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32953","excerpt":"<p>Maybe I’m in the Las Vegas spirit, but if I were a betting man, I’d bet a dollar every time I heard someone say “hybrid cloud” and undoubtedly, I’d hit the jackpot.  Why?

IBM’s Center for Applied Insight recently found that 85 percent of leading hybrid cloud adopters report that hybrid cloud is accelerating digital transformation in their organization.</p>\n<p>But IBM’s message isn’t just that hybrid is the way forward. A hybrid cloud is only as good as the open technology that supports it.</p>\n<p>If Sunday’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joeweinman/status/701592014639353856\">standing-room-only</a> crowd at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IBMOTS&amp;src=typd\">IBM Open Technology Summit</a> (OTS) is any indication, the enthusiasm surrounding open tech is stronger than ever.</p>\n<p>A registered crowd of more than 1,400 packed the room to hear from IBM executives and external open technology stakeholders like Cloud Foundry Foundation CEO Sam Ramji and OpenStack Foundation executive director Jonathan Bryce.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the OTS on Sunday, LeBlanc, who pioneered IBM’s commitment to open 20 years ago, called open technology “the foundation of the next generation of cloud.”</p>\n<p><strong>No one wants cloud molasses</strong></p>\n<p>Dr. Angel Diaz, IBM vice president of Cloud Technology &amp; Architecture, has long maintained that if you’re not building your cloud ecosystem with open technology, you’re building “a dead-end cloud.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://images3.newscred.com/Zz0zOTBmZmY4YzI2MGFiMWViMDhhMDRkNTcwYTc0Y2UyMg==\" alt=\"Angel Diaz at Open Tech Summit.png\" width=\"310\" height=\"233\" /></p>\n<p>Consider an instance where a team decides to build an application while working with a system that has a single source for infrastructure. If that team has to tap into proprietary APIs, proprietary middleware, Diaz insists the team will inevitably find themselves stuck with little to no options.</p>\n<p>“[In this scenario] you simply cannot extend your cloud,” Diaz says. “You’re living in the molasses of cloud.”</p>\n<p>The solution? Partner with a vendor who uses open technology across their infrastructure, platform, APIs, solutions and services.</p>\n<p>“That gives you choice and consistency on-prem and off-prem,” Diaz says.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice is power</strong></p>\n<p>IBM Fellow and chief technology officer of Cloud Platform Services Jerry Cuomo says “open by design” is more than a slogan—it’s a commitment to open technology that’s providing users with what he calls “freedom of action.”</p>\n<p>“You want to be able to work where there’s a grand resource pool that you can choose from,” Cuomo says. “A CIO working with a vendor that is open has choice. Choice brings freedom. Freedom brings power. Power brings acceleration—the ability to get your job done in an amazing way to delight your end users.”</p>\n<p><strong>An industry perspective</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong>Tim Crawford, CIO Strategic Advisor for AVOA, says that every customer is looking for something different. As those customers go through the process moving from current state to future state—and where hybrid fits into that journey—their needs will vary and evolve over time.</p>\n<p>“At some point in the journey, everybody could benefit from some component of open,” Crawford says. “I think it will show up and manifest itself at different stages as they go through that process.”</p>\n<p><em>To learn more about IBM’s open technology offerings, visit </em><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/\"><em>developerWorks Open</em></a><em> and the </em><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/architecture/\"><em>IBM Cloud Architecture Center</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/02/open-technology-the-key-to-an-effective-hybrid-cloud/","date":"2016-02-23T12:00:59","modified":"2016-12-16T05:02:20","format":"standard","slug":"open-technology-key-effective-hybrid-cloud","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32941","excerpt":"<p>At IBM InterConnect 2016, hybrid cloud is everywhere.

Eighty percent of businesses are leveraging cloud as a key ingredient to do just that.</p>\n<p>While some say businesses must start from scratch or move everything to the cloud, we believe there is a better choice. Hybrid cloud is key to digital innovation. IBM offers clients choice with consistency to seamlessly integrate both traditional IT and cloud services that will deliver benefits their businesses’ needs.  This is why IBM is #1 in hybrid cloud.(1)</p>\n<p>On Monday, IBM made this even easier with a range of <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49155.wss\">new announcements</a> that accelerate hybrid cloud adoption.  Based on engagement with over 500 clients leveraging hybrid cloud, we have discovered the three most common on ramps to hybrid cloud and have enhanced our products and our services partnerships to speed these journeys. As organizations leverage hybrid cloud to deliver digital business models, they most often cite these business goals.  They want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create</strong> new compelling solutions at speed</li>\n<li><strong>Connect</strong> their existing capabilities to the cloud for the broadest reach</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize</strong> their operations and service delivery to scale to meet demand</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s dive into each of these a bit more on how we can help reach those goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating new compelling solutions at speed</strong></p>\n<p>To foster innovation and optimize the customer experience, it is critical that new cloud apps can be rapidly built, deployed, improved and connected to existing servers with agile DevOps.  Developers need the choice of runtimes supporting the broadest range of languages to maximize their productivity with access to the most innovative services. IT managers need a platform to deploy these at scale with the instrumentation to monitor adoption. IBM Bluemix is that platform for hybrid innovation, and we just added a host of new Bluemix services, like new Watson services with cognitive APIs, OpenWhisk, and Blockchain DevOps services.</p>\n<p>With tools and runtimes support for Node.js, Java, Swift and .NET, IBM Bluemix is a one-stop shop developers want. With a new Github partnership, this got even better. If you need help getting started, our Bluemix garages are the perfect place to go.</p>\n<p><strong>Connect the billions of dollars invested in enterprise IT with new cloud services</strong></p>\n<p>Creating apps is important but it’s equally important that existing apps and data can be effortlessly published and consumed for innovation and monetization. This is where the new series of Connect offerings for IBM Cloud come into play. IBM has introduced WebSphere Connect to easily cloud-enabled WebSphere apps by accessing cloud services direct from on-premise middleware. With more than 250 million global instances of WebSphere, IBM’s middleware portfolio touches approximately 80 percent of all global transactions.</p>\n<p>Now all WebSphere clients will be able to access new feature updates directly from the cloud. This exciting announcement includes other key IBM products: API Connect, App Connect, DataWorks, Websphere Blockchain Connect and zOS Connect.</p>\n<p>For hybrid cloud solutions to work, backend data and customer-facing applications need to be connected to each other from anywhere. By delivering these Connect products on the IBM Cloud to link the enterprise to the cloud, developers and business leaders have the best of both worlds opening up limitless possibilities for the broadest ecosystem access.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Optimize operations to scale</strong></p>\n<p>Optimizing workloads across cloud and traditional IT gives disruptors choice with consistency and the freedom to choose which environment is the best fit for their needs. With our hybrid cloud management capabilities and our PureApp Service on SoftLayer, portability and growth of these workloads is available for public, dedicated or local clouds. We just made this even easier with our new partnership with VMware,making IBM the top choice for hybrid cloud.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which on-ramp you take to hybrid cloud, it is increasingly evident that businesses want the flexibility and choice that only IBM Cloud can offer.  With our new suite of Connect offerings, integrating on premise systems to cloud solutions has never been simpler.

According to a recent CIO article,(1) in a study of 930 IT professionals, 88% are using public cloud technology and 63% are using private cloud. A whopping 82% have a hybrid cloud strategy, which is up from 74% in 2014, evidence that this is a phenomenon that is here to stay.</p>\n<p>It is no longer a question of when a company will move to the cloud, but how. How does a business reconcile existing IT infrastructure and applications into a cloud model without sacrificing security, reliability and speed? How do businesses increase revenue while maintaining a seamless customer experience?</p>\n<p>The key challenges that drive our clients to move to a cloud model are similar across industries and organizations. These include the desire to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deliver</strong> a flexible consumption model across all environments</li>\n<li><strong>Unlock</strong> the billions of dollars invested in apps and data that exist in the enterprise by exposing them as APIs for enterprise integration</li>\n<li><strong>Differentiate</strong> with data and improve the ability to provide insight from it</li>\n<li><strong>Provide </strong>deeper customer engagement and understanding of how to extract value from dark data</li>\n<li><strong>Accelerate</strong> the creation of new products, services and business models</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’re seeing a pattern with many of today’s fastest growing, and most innovative companies. In an effort to create new revenue streams, and drive new customers, they are relying on APIs more than ever. It is predicted that 80% of large global enterprises will offer public web APIs by 2017.(2) But to make this a reality, to drive real business value, requires an API strategy built on a hybrid cloud.  When done right, those same leaders tend to see better client engagement and loyalty because they have visibility into each transaction, every application, and use data to make nearly every decision. In order to reap these types of benefits from hybrid cloud, enterprises need a strategic approach for integrating all of the APIs, applications, databases in public, private and hybrid environments across the business,</p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that IBM is all in on the hybrid cloud of the future. Now, with 100% of IBM’s enterprise software available on-premise and in the cloud, we’re helping companies of all sizes take advantage of the choice and flexibility that the hybrid cloud provides them.</p>\n<p>Today, we are announcing an exciting new series of “Connect” offerings for IBM Cloud to ease and improve the transition to a hybrid model. This new series of offerings will extend IBM’s leading middleware capabilities in the cloud. This gives existing clients a rapid path to hybrid, while also attracting new buyers with the most comprehensive set of hybrid integration technologies – delivered through a flexible consumption and pricing model.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images2.newscred.com/Zz1hZGE4NmI3YjNkZWQ3MDczZjQ3MzNkYWFjOWI0MGZlZA==\" alt=\"MWblog.png\" width=\"824\" height=\"215\" /></p>\n<p>IBM has been the application and middleware leader for 14 consecutive years, with 29% market share, outpacing the competition by more than two times, according to Gartner, based on total worldwide revenue for 2014.(3) Combined with a powerful cloud platform, IBM’s expertise in complex integration is paying off as digital enterprises move to the cloud.</p>\n<p>With over 100,000 enterprises using IBM’s on-premise capabilities today, businesses can realize immediate benefits from having greater choice and flexibility by leveraging these new offerings to create their ideal hybrid cloud solution.</p>\n<p>One immediate benefit of the pay-as-you-go model is cost savings. Many businesses are <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/application-server-on-cloud/us/en-us\">saving up to 30%</a> or more when moving their applications to the cloud.  Cost savings and a platform ideal for developing next-generation Java apps with microservices and APIs makes for a combination that is hard to beat.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how hybrid cloud and how the new series of “Connect” offerings can aid you in your cloud journey, read the <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49155.wss\">press release</a> and explore what IBM Cloud has to offer <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/solutions/middleware/index.html?cmp=IBMSocial&amp;ct=C43202QW&amp;cm=h&amp;IIO=BSYS&amp;csr=twitter&amp;cr=casyst&amp;ccy=us\">here</a>.</p>\n<hr width=\"800\" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CIO.com, “<a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/3018156/cloud-computing/cloud-adoption-soars-but-integration-challenges-remain.html\">Cloud adoption soars, but integration challenges remain”</a>, January 2016</li>\n<li>Gartner, Hype Cycle for Application Development, 2015, G00277761</li>\n<li>Market Share for All Software Markets, Worldwide, 2014, Gartner, 31 March 2015, G00273284</li>\n</ol>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/02/unlocking-billions-of-dollars-with-hybrid-cloud/","date":"2016-02-22T12:00:24","modified":"2016-12-16T05:15:49","format":"standard","slug":"unlocking-billions-dollars-hybrid-cloud","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32933","excerpt":"<p>As we move into 2016, it has become apparent that cloud is at a tipping point.

In the latest OMNIbus Integrations release, support for Juniper’s Contrail products has been added. This builds on top of the support for CISCO APIC that was announced in 2015. The production of a dedicated probe for Contrail allows Operations Insight users to manage their Juniper NFV deployment consistently with their existing network.

This move aims to make it easier for developers to unlock the valuable data, knowledge and transaction systems, such as supply chain, inventory management systems and detailed customer records, at the center of global business.</p>\n<p>According to IBM’s Center for Applied Insights global study of 500 cloud decisions makers, organizations are increasingly integrating cloud resources with traditional IT to accommodate dynamic needs and specific business priorities.1 The mix will continue to shift as companies grow their use of private and public cloud to manage dynamic and increasingly digital business priorities. Further, a report from IDC states that over 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud architectures by 2017.2</p>\n<p>At the heart of these transformational shifts are developers, a population expected to top 25 million by 20203, who are charged with building new cloud frameworks and coding new products, apps and services.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating on-premises data and applications.  To meet these demands, IBM unveiled a new series of “Connect” offerings for IBM Cloud that will fundamentally transform how enterprise clients extend their existing IT investments and capabilities to the Cloud. To allow for this strategic transformation, IBM&#8217;s software is now available on the cloud via public, private or on-premises delivery models.  Delivered as an easy to consume cloud service, developers can connect applications and data sources together, no matter where they reside.</p>\n<p>Core to this announcement is IBM WebSphere Connect, which extends IBM&#8217;s industry leading WebSphere portfolio to the cloud. With more than 200 million global licenses of WebSphere, IBM&#8217;s middleware portfolio is the leading platform for Java EE.  Today’s news will make it easier for the estimated 13 million Java developers worldwide to connect their apps to the cloud, and continue to extend WebSphere to a whole new community of node.js and Swift developers4.  Moving forward, WebSphere clients can access new features from the IBM Cloud.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Businesses are adopting cloud based applications to accelerate innovation, but they are still struggling to combine those cloud native services with existing apps and data which reside on-premises,” said Marie Wieck, general manager, IBM Cloud Application Services. “Our objective is to drastically simplify how developers discover and connect disparate apps and services, so enterprises can unlock the value of their existing IT and more rapidly capture the value of the cloud. This helps enable developers to discover and re-use the best capabilities, where ever they reside.”</p>\n<p>For example, the Expert Tech MobileFirst for iOS app built by IBM helps field service technician solve complex problems or tough questions on the spot. While the app is very simple to use, it can draw on 12 existing back-end systems, such as content management, customer relationship management, vehicle management and inventory management, that can run on WebSphere to provide the necessary information. For the average developer, such as one fresh out of school, a data source or system that might provide the customer with a better experience or help them to gain a better answer, needs to be easily discoverable and usable. With today&#8217;s news, IBM is making data or systems easy to consume over the cloud, whether it actually resides on the cloud or not.</p>\n<p>Starting immediately, the enterprises currently using IBM’s on-premises software can use these new offerings as on ramp to hybrid cloud, to realize the immediate benefits and new value from their existing investments.</p>\n<p>In addition to IBM WebSphere connect, the other new “Connect” offerings for IBM Cloud include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API Connect &#8211; This first-of-kind service allows any client to publish its IT as an API –making it easy to find, call and connect over the cloud. Additionally, it helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance.</li>\n<li>App Connect &#8211; A new software-as-a-service offering that provides hundreds of pre-built connections to cloud and on-premises applications designed to help line-of-business professionals speed through integration tasks.<br />\nMessage Connect &#8211; A new Bluemix service that connects IBM Messaging portfolio to the Bluemix Message Hub services creating a true hybrid messaging offering.</li>\n<li>DataWorks &#8211; Based on the leading open source analytics project, Apache Spark, DataWorks is a service that can enable analysts, developers, data scientists and data engineers to prepare and move data from on premises and off premises to an analytics cloud ecosystem where it can be quickly analyzed and visualized.</li>\n<li>IBM WebSphere Blockchain Connect &#8211; A new service available to all WebSphere clients that is designed to provide a safe and encrypted passage from their blockchain cloud to their enterprise.<br />\nIBM z/OS Connect &#8211; A new version of the offering that creates APIs and RESTful interfaces for all apps running on IBM z Systems, connecting data and apps sitting on the mainframe with the cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about how migrating middleware to the cloud just got easier, visit here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Source: IBM Center for Applied Insights, Growing up Hybrid, 2016</li>\n<li>Source: IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Cloud 2016 Predictions – Mastering the Raw Material of Digital Transformation, Doc #259840</li>\n<li>Source: Global Developer Population and Demographic Study Volume 2, 2015</li>\n<li>Source: Global Developer Population and Demographic Study Volume I, 2015</li>\n</ol>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/02/ibm-moves-to-unlock-billions-of-dollars-in-it-value-for-cloud-developers/","date":"2016-02-16T12:00:41","modified":"2016-12-16T04:41:22","format":"standard","slug":"ibm-moves-to-unlock-billions-of-dollars-in-it-value-for-cloud-developers","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=31997","excerpt":"<p>Las Vegas &#8211; IBM INTERCONNECT 2016 &#8211; 22 Feb 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it is extending its pervasive software platform to the cloud, helping enable clients to connect to data, application or transaction system.

It is becoming clear that video can help businesses meet these needs. Video overcomes the physical inhibitors present in the real world while leveraging the benefits of the digital world. It shortens the time to insights while eliminating the challenge of distance.</p>\n<p>As we enter the cognitive era, speed matters. Business systems are challenged by the requirement to rapidly gain insight about all their users, both internal and external. These systems must adapt in real time, to immediately learn from those insights, and to swiftly respond. By leveraging global Cloud architectures, businesses can provide agile and scalable platforms that connect immediately with people all over the world. And, increasingly that connection will be ‘video’.</p>\n<p>With video emerging as the world’s dominant data type, live video provides an immediacy and impact that can transform the way we entertain, learn, communicate and relate. In a recent survey of millennials, ages 18-29, over 70% use a streaming service.* So it is no surprise that services that offer real-time, live video are transforming the way that value is created. Today, IBM announced the acquisition of Ustream, yet again expanding the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/ustream\">IBM Cloud platform</a> to enable solutions and services that can deliver streaming video on a global scale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/ustream/\">Ustream</a> provides a cloud-based service that combines live video encoding and streaming, multi-device support, and the performance and scalability to serve millions of viewers. Ustream’s video service APIs will allow IBM to provide distinct, composable, video services through IBM Bluemix, enabling cloud developers to build new video applications or utilize video within their existing applications.</p>\n<p>Ustream services can help businesses in all industries capture opportunities in a rapidly changing marketplace – using real-time, live video to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Align employees with the business with effective tools for education, training, and internal communications</li>\n<li>Expand reach by generating demand for new offerings, products and services.</li>\n<li>Offer professional quality broadcasts for events to a global audience of employees, customers and/or partners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Ustream, businesses can rapidly exploit the power of video in traditional applications, such as news, education, live streaming of events – product launches and signature events – and deliver  new value in emerging and innovative applications, like telemedicine, public safety and  surveillance.  With Ustream and IBM Cloud, business can make video available globally, on a reliable, and scalable platform.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/\">Ustream</a>.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/01/real-time-cloud-based-video-on-rise/","date":"2016-01-27T12:00:15","modified":"2016-12-16T05:00:21","format":"standard","slug":"real-time-cloud-based-video-rise","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32929","excerpt":"<p>Each day we each experience the power of real-time video – to inform us, to educate us, to entertain us and to connect us to each other.

This new functionality enables content owners to create and manage temporary passwords that are used to broadcast both external and internal live video for an enterprise. Compatible encoders for this feature range from mobile apps to software to even hardware based encoders.</p>\n<p>Management of this feature is controlled directly from the cloud based platform. Administrators can generate new login details for users. This login and password then allows participants given the code to broadcast live content to this account. This is done through using the credentials to login to an encoder, which can be a mobile app or third party Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)-based encoders. For example, login information can be given to an executive to allow them to live broadcast using their mobile phone to a secure, internal channel for a town hall. Another example would be login details given to a contractor to allow them to publish from a third party hardware encoder for a product launch to a large, external audience.</p>\n<p>Through the platform, access can also be revoked. This creates a scenario where these login details are as permanent or as temporary as needed. For example, in the above scenario when the contractor is done with the product launch their login details for the encoder can be revoked.</p>\n<p>This feature works with both IBM Cloud Video Streaming Manager and IBM Cloud Video Streaming Manager for Enterprise.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/blog/2017/01/17/manage-temporary-passwords-for-video-encoder-access/?utm_source=IBM.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=temporary_passwords_feature&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_announcement_blog\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about how to manage temporary passwords</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2017/01/manage-temporary-passwords-live-streaming-encoders/","date":"2017-01-31T17:39:28","modified":"2017-02-01T12:07:34","format":"standard","slug":"manage-temporary-passwords-live-streaming-encoders","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=33442","excerpt":"<p>IBM Cloud Video has launched a new capability that improves direct access to live video encoders for multiple users.

Our network operations team are going to like this.” A systems manager I recently met in the UK made these positive comments regarding the newly-released Network Device Dashboard, part of the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/it-operations-management/us/en-us\">IBM Netcool Operations Insight</a> (NOI) offering. This new device-centric dashboard presents a view of all relevant device data to enable quick resolution of network issues.</p>\n<p>The Network Device Dashboard aims to empower the network operations manager to deliver a better network service. It was designed specifically with network operations use cases. Its integrated tooling can better manage all network operations, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership. The dashboard also features the network event, topology and performance capabilities. And it is backed up by insightful and efficient analytics that enable operations support personnel to deliver a reliable network service to the company.</p>\n<p>The Network Device Dashboard delivers rapid network performance problem resolution. Here’s how it works.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 1:  Identify a network incident</strong></h3>\n<p>How will you know about issues affecting your network? The dashboard’s Netcool analytical capability first reduces chaotic event storms to manageable incidents. <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCVHB\" target=\"_blank\">Network Performance Insight</a> plays a key role in this step, especially in identifying performance related anomalies. It detects and alerts performance threshold violations in real-time. It configurable options helps you avoid false alerts.</p>\n<p>From the specific device-related incident, operations personnel can launch the Network Device Dashboard to facilitate further investigation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-39179\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard-300x115.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard-300x115.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard-768x295.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Operations-Dashboard.png 1005w\" alt=\"ibm-netcool-operations-insight-network--dashboard\" width=\"600\" height=\"230\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Step 2:  Isolate a network performance issue</strong></h3>\n<p>For performance-related anomalies, the Network Device Dashboard can give you an integrated view of related events, topology and device-specific performance metrics. To isolate problems, you first need to look at the network topology view that shows the device outage and its impact on neighboring devices. By default, the adjacent widget highlights specific performance metric threshold violations. You can view recent variations in this performance metric value to help understand the problem and gain greater insight into the overall device behavior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM%E2%80%99s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-39182\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM%E2%80%99s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map-300x140.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM’s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map-300x140.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM’s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map-768x358.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM’s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map-1024x478.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/of-IBM’s-Netcool-Operations-Insight-Network-Device-Dashboard-Map.png 1042w\" alt=\"of-ibms-netcool-operations-insight-network-device-dashboard-map\" width=\"600\" height=\"280\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Resolve the issue</strong></h3>\n<p>The final step in resolving performance related issues is to get insight into traffic related issues on device interfaces. The Network Device Dashboard automatically highlights violating interfaces; operators can easily assess the worst interface specific metrics on key network links. They can then gain insight into the applications consuming the link bandwidth by launching the Performance Insight flow capability.</p>\n<p>We’re excited about our new integrated Netcool Operations Insight performance capabilities and how they can help our clients.

It seems like a long time ago, but it was just 12 short months ago in Portland, Oregon.</p>\n<p>OSCON 2015 was especially important for IBM: not only did we return in a <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/44737\" target=\"_blank\">keynote speaking role</a>, but we announced a brand new initiative that would help incubate exciting new open source projects. A July 22 <a href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47362.wss\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> highlighted the developerWorks Open launch and generated a lot of coverage in publications including <em><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-open-sources-50-enterprise-apps-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">ZDNet</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.itworld.com/article/2951595/ibm-moves-open-source-business-software-to-the-cloud.html\" target=\"_blank\">ITWorld</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2951482/cloud-development/ibm-woos-cloud-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\">CIO</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Was this announcement news? You bet. But was it completely new? Well, yes and no.</p>\n<h2>Evolution of IBM open source</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been developing enterprise software for a while, you might remember IBM alphaWorks. Way back in August 1996, IBM started a customized effort to share binary executable programs with the outside world. This effort was branded alphaWorks, a special initiative focused on sharing emerging software, which to that point been kept behind the IBM firewall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/alphaworkslogo.gif\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-34884\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-34884\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/alphaworkslogo.gif\" alt=\"alphaworkslogo\" width=\"314\" height=\"75\" /></a>The alphaWorks site quickly became a popular destination on <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">developerWorks</a>, IBM’s software developer web portal. The new site was expanded to include a variety of software project types and soon earned a great reputation, becoming viewed as a “merit badge” for IBMers writing innovative code to share with the outside world.</p>\n<p>With the rise of open source development tooling and repo projects such as <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Git</a> in 2005 and <a href=\"https://github.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> in 2008, the need for alphaWorks began to fade, and the name was effectively sunset around 2010. Over the last five years, the number of <a href=\"http://ibm.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM repos on GitHub</a> has grown rapidly, and today that number is at or near one thousand.</p>\n<p>So with that volume of IBM open source code already on GitHub, what is the role of developerWorks Open?</p>\n<h2>Building communities, connecting innovators</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/developerWorks-Open2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-34886\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-34886\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/developerWorks-Open2.png\" alt=\"developerWorks-Open2\" width=\"200\" height=\"79\" /></a>IBM is more committed than ever to open source software, and developerWorks Open highlights some of the newest, most innovative, high-potential projects from IBM developers. Much more than just an index of projects, dWO features blogs, videos, and personal developer stories so that users can better understand the people <em>behind</em> the projects. We provide community links, Slack channels, and connection points to help you explore each project and get to know the people who are working on them. We also provide project leaders with best practice guidance, helping ensure that their project has a chance to flourish and grow.</p>\n<p>We feature all kinds of projects, from big, enterprise-level tools and platforms to small, boutique functions and apps. If it shows promise, we’re going to help it grow.</p>\n<p>A great example of a project that launched on dW Open and subsequently graduated is <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/ibm-open-blockchain/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Blockchain</a>, which has now become part of <a href=\"https://www.hyperledger.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperledger</a>, a collaborative project of the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger is a distributed transaction processing initiative supported by multiple organizations to advance features associated with distributed ledgers. Other developerWorks projects currently incubating include <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/node-red/\" target=\"_blank\">Node-RED</a>, a tool for wiring together the Internet of Things; <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/openwhisk/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenWhisk</a>, a new event-driven platform for serverless computing; and <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/amalgam8/\" target=\"_blank\">Amalgam8</a>, a platform to simplify the integration tasks needed for polyglot microservices.</p>\n<h2>The future is open</h2>\n<p>If you like open source software, you’ll find something to capture your imagination on developerWorks Open. Whether you’re an open source newbie or veteran, check out our <a href=\"https://www.developer.ibm.com/open/projects\" target=\"_blank\">Projects page</a> and browse among the dozens of projects that we’ve featured over the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>You can also stay connected by following us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IBMdwOpen\" target=\"_blank\">@IBMdWOpen</a> — like, retweet, or just let us know what you think.

They want to extend their existing WebSphere systems of record, differentiate new on-cloud WebSphere Liberty applications, or in other cases, take advantage of new cloud and Bluemix® services within their existing WebSphere systems of record. This can enable them to quickly enhance those applications with new, cloud-based added value. The WebSphere Connect strategy quickly makes the promises of hybrid a reality for WebSphere Application Server clients.</p>\n<p>The drive to hybrid WebSphere implementations created a need for a simplified, cloud-friendly and term-subscription type of licensing. To satisfy this requirement, the Virtual Processor Core (VPC) is a simplified license metric that is sold as a monthly license charge and is offered for WebSphere Application Server. VPC is a simple metric that applies to on-premise deployments and also on on-cloud deployments. It makes it easier to transition between hybrid deployment options.</p>\n<p>The WebSphere Application Server editions that offer the new VPC monthly metric include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WebSphere Family Edition</li>\n<li>WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment</li>\n<li>WebSphere Application Server</li>\n<li>WebSphere Application Server Liberty Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All current versions and releases of these WebSphere Application Server editions are eligible for the VPC metric.</p>\n<p>The pricing metrics that are available for the perpetual licensing options of WebSphere Application Server, remain unchanged by this announcement.</p>\n<p>With WebSphere and VPC monthly pricing, clients pay for what they need on a term and subscription basis. They can easily optimize application deployment between on-premises and the on-cloud deployments of their choice. A VPC is a processor core in an unpartitioned physical server, or a virtual core that is assigned to a virtual server. Clients must obtain entitlement for each VPC that is available to WebSphere. The counting rules are simple. Basically, if clients have a virtual core available to their WebSphere Application Server, they license a VPC for it regardless of whether they are on-premises or in the cloud. In cases where clients know how many physical cores that are being used, they license the lesser of the number of virtual cores or physical cores.</p>\n<p><b>VPC counting examples</b></p>\n<p><i>Example 1</i></p>\n<p>In a cloud deployment, the client:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buys a Virtual Cloud Server as a Service on a internal private cloud or public cloud service provider, such as SoftLayer®, Azure, or Amazon.</li>\n<li>Purchases an 8-core Virtual CPU environment.</li>\n<li>Must license 8 VPCs for this environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>Example 2</i></p>\n<p>On-premises deployment that uses VMWare, the client:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploys multiple VMWare hosts to run WebSphere. The server is a 2 Socket server with 4 cores per socket. The total number of physical cores is 8.</li>\n<li>Runs 16 VMWare hosts running WebSphere on the server. The total number of virtual cores across the VMWare hosts is 16.</li>\n<li>As the hardware can be physically identified as a 8-core server, the client only pays for 8 VPCs and not 16. It is the lesser of the two numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While not required for use of VPC, the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#%21/wiki/IBM%20License%20Metric%20Tool/page/Determining%20the%20usage%20of%20Virtual%20Processor%20Cores%20%28VPC%29\" target=\"_blank\"> IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT)</a> can help clients determine their level of VPC usage.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/7/897/ENUS216-307/index.html&amp;lang=en&amp;request_locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a></strong></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/07/check-out-the-new-hybrid-cloud-monthly-pricing-options-for-was/","date":"2016-07-12T12:00:05","modified":"2016-12-16T04:23:51","format":"standard","slug":"check-out-the-new-hybrid-cloud-monthly-pricing-options-for-was","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32161","excerpt":"<p>More and more businesses deploy IBM® WebSphere® Application Server within a mixed hybrid environment of on-premises and on-cloud deployments.

Its location in this tech learning community for students, startups and established companies will deepen IBM’s roots in the city’s thriving tech scene, and build on IBM’s work with disruptive New York City companies such as Alpha Modus, an investment tech firm.</p>\n<p>“Ramping up more companies on Bluemix will be a significant addition to New York City’s tech economy, as it enables financial tech companies like us to innovate with APIs such as Watson,” said Prashant Bhuyan, cofounder and CEO of Alpha Modus. “Using Bluemix, we’ve been able to roll out transformational apps that leverage cognitive analytics with unbelievable time and efficiency –helping to shake up the way our clients invest in the markets.”</p>\n<p>Since 2014, IBM Cloud has partnered with the City of New York to power the city’s Digital.NYC platform, a hub for New York City’s rapidly growing startup economy. Currently, nearly 8,000 startups – over half of the city’s startup base<sup>2</sup> – are using Digital.NYC to connect and collaborate. Also in 2014, the company announced the opening of its Astor Place offices, which serves as the headquarters for both its Watson and Cloud businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Galvanize has been a great home and partner for IBM’s groundbreaking Bluemix Garage on our San Francisco campus, and we are excited to bring that partnership to New York City,” said Jim Deters, co-founder and CEO of Galvanize. “Having IBM’s Garage in New York City, within the Galvanize community, allows our strong network of developers and startups to leverage the power of the cloud and the expertise of IBM to competitively innovate products and apps in the growing fintech and blockchain spaces.”</p>\n<p>Located at 315 Hudson Street in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood, an area which in recent years has become a mecca for startups, the newest Garage will help spur innovation via:</p>\n<p><strong>Business Development</strong>: Combining enterprise expertise, agile methods, and IBM Design Thinking, a unique process to design, build and deploy, Garage consultants help clients to refine, iterate on and deliver a business idea into an app.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/06/check-out-our-new-bluemix-garage-in-nyc-for-cloud-developers/","date":"2016-06-28T12:00:53","modified":"2016-12-15T11:34:49","format":"standard","slug":"check-out-our-new-bluemix-garage-in-nyc-for-cloud-developers","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32247","excerpt":"<p>New York, NY &#8211; 28 Jun 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the opening of an IBM Bluemix Garage in New York City, which will help power the city’s growing concentration of developers, entrepreneurs, and fintech companies with cloud and blockchain.

Their response to me was that they simply did not see IBM in this space; neither a positive nor a negative view. It became quite clear that we needed to be a part of their community instead of on the outside trying to sell to them.</p>\n<p>We came up with the idea of the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/garage/\">IBM Bluemix Garages</a> from there: co-locate with incubators that have an established presence within the startup community while directly bringing modern application development practices and innovation solutions to clients.</p>\n<h2>IBM commitment to NYC<strong><br />\n</strong></h2>\n<p>Our most recent IBM Bluemix Garage opened today in New York City, specifically designed to help enterprises use Blockchain technology on the cloud. It’s co-located within <a href=\"http://www.galvanize.com/\">Galvanize’s</a> new campus in Soho. This is our seventh Garage, with others in San Francisco, London, Toronto, Nice, Tokyo and Singapore … with more to come.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6014\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garage-map-1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garage-map-1-300x158.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garage-map-1-768x404.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garage-map-1.png 844w\" alt=\"bluemix-garage-map\" width=\"650\" height=\"342\" /></p>\n<p>What we have found is that the Garages provide true melting pots for startups and enterprises, which help teams innovate faster using new technologies and methods. Yes, enterprises can learn to be as fast and customer-focused as startups. It’s a two-way street. Startups learn how to build apps and cloud services that meet the exacting demands of enterprise customers, which is a huge market. Plus, it is important to focus on the culture change of moving to the cloud.</p>\n<p>The promise of Blockchain innovation has the potential to take an already thriving NYC fintech scene to new heights. Our newest Bluemix Garage in this entrepreneurial, co-working NYC community will deepen IBM roots in the city’s thriving tech scene in finance, design and other industries, building on top of IBM work with disruptive New York companies such as <a href=\"http://alphamodus.com/\">Alpha Modus</a>, an investment tech firm.</p>\n<h2>An environment for innovation</h2>\n<p>If you have not been to an IBM Bluemix Garage, they are experience environments that harness face-to-face collaboration and offer clients a wide range of innovation disciplines.</p>\n<p>IBM Bluemix is the obvious cloud platform of choice in which the technology environment enables rapid innovation based on open standards and open source software. It offers more than 140 tools and services, spanning Blockchain, big data, mobile, Watson, analytics, integration, security and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>\n<p>Our IBM Bluemix Garage Method helps clients navigate the innovation process, merging a variety of disciplines, including IBM design thinking, lean startup, agile software development, and DevOps, a discipline that’s increasingly critical for enterprise IT departments</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qmm7wGZDc5c?feature=oembed\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The Garages focus on small projects. Then we run tests to ensure it is a successful idea and adopted by the users. Then we scale. By combining learning and doing, a team emerges with a transformational, new approach to innovation and their first application on IBM Bluemix.</p>\n<p>For instance, a major retailer dipped its toes in the water by building an app for its corporate communications team in just four weeks. The app uses Watson Tone Analyzer, among other capabilities, to evaluate the initial drafts of executive speeches to gauge whether they will be well received by target audiences. Its assessments guide adjustments.</p>\n<h2>Focus on people and culture</h2>\n<p>There’s a temptation to focus on technology as the be-all and end-all, but our Garage experiences have proven that when our clients focus on people and culture, they succeed. They put in place the right people with the right mindsets and skills, which promotes a culture of open collaboration and teaches a set of innovation methods.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6015\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garages-collage.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garages-collage-285x300.png 285w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluemix-garages-collage.png 606w\" alt=\"bluemix-garages-collage\" width=\"606\" height=\"638\" /></p>\n<p>When given a technology platform like IBM Bluemix that provides a wide range of choices, our clients can truly address the problems they’re trying to solve and to help the users they’re trying to serve at a pace they have never been able to before.</p>\n<p>The critical factors we’ve learned in our first two years of running the IBM Bluemix Garages is that talent and culture go hand-in-hand.

Alert Notification is an easy-to-use notification service that meets the increasing demand for agility and efficient collaboration among IT operations and DevOps team members who use multiple monitoring and management tools. IT staffs receive instant notification alerts for any issues in the IT operations environment, optimizing your business performance, increasing customer satisfaction and protecting revenue.</p>\n<p>Since Alert Notification is provided as a service, management and installation of the required infrastructure is handled by IBM, reducing your time-to-value and offering low-maintenance ownership.</p>\n<p>IBM Alert Notification was built from the ground up to help IT ops and DevOps teams who want to communicate effectively and efficiently to solve problems faster before they impact businesses and their customers.</p>\n<p>IBM Alert Notification allows IT ops and DevOps teams to save time and money by sending actionable alerts to the appropriate people or groups at the appropriate time using methods including email, SMS, voice, mobile apps or Slack (new!)</p>\n<p>No more missed communications about an IT event that needs immediate attention. And in the event that the alert notification is not acknowledged within the organization’s specified time period, the notification is escalated.</p>\n<p>The new scheduling feature makes Alert Notification even easier to use and takes into account the need for organizations to set up on-duty and on-call shifts. The process of scheduling is considered to be one of the most time-consuming tasks that prevent users from utilizing a notification tool. When designing the new scheduling feature, we collected input from all types of users to ensure that the experience was intuitive and required minimal steps to utilize. Users have the ability to customize or use out-of-the-box templates.</p>\n<p>Users can manually create shifts or they can use built -shift patterns to get their scheduling done faster. The new scheduling software is even smart enough to schedule users or groups by itself for weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>With the new scheduling feature you can be assured that you will have around-the clock-coverage and can be alerted to any gaps in coverage.</p>\n<p>And for users who want to be reminded when they are on duty or on call, IBM Alert Notification can do that for you too!</p>\n<p>With Alert Notification, you will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never miss your actionable critical alerts.</li>\n<li>Immediately route alerts to the right people.</li>\n<li>Speed alert responses with automated escalation policies.</li>\n<li>Schedule your coverage weeks in advance</li>\n<li>Notify your staff when they are on duty and on call</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explore countless benefits and take a look at the new capabilities of IBM Alert Notification on <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/alert-notification/us/en-us#product-header\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Marketplace.</a> We encourage you to see how easy IBM Alert Notification is to use with a 60-day trial.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/bringing-saas-ibm-alert-notification/","date":"2016-06-20T12:00:15","modified":"2016-12-15T11:31:26","format":"standard","slug":"bringing-saas-ibm-alert-notification","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32311","excerpt":"<p>We are excited to announce new capabilities along with the IBM Alert Notification SaaS offering that was first announced earlier this year.

a future in which a computer reduces the time and effort required to develop new drugs or saves lives with more accurate weather forecasting. Quantum computers find answers to complex sets of problems that today’s classical (non-quantum) computers are really bad at. Classical computers operate by sequentially manipulating “strings of bits” that can either be a “0” or a “1.”  Quantum computers operate using “qubits” which can be a “0,” “1” or both simultaneously. Quantum computers can solve problems faster because “qubits” exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing algorithms to complete their analyses in fewer steps than classical computers.</p>\n<p>In May, I was excited to see that IBM made quantum computing available to the public on the IBM Cloud platform. I was eager to increase my quantum computing knowledge, so I signed up for access. Since I really didn’t know anything about qubits, superposition, entanglement, gates, or quantum algorithms, I spent four hours completing the quantum computing tutorial available through the portal. Quantum computing is different than traditional computer science, so you have to be willing to “let go of what you know.” Quantum computing involves computation, so you should be prepared for a high-school math refresher as you take the tutorial.</p>\n<p>The portal has a quantum computing simulator called the “composer” that I used throughout the tutorial to try out the quantum computing concepts I was learning. The simulator’s user interface (shown below) looks a bit like sheet music. Each line represents a qubit. Quantum computer algorithms are created by “dragging and dropping” various logic gates onto lines and connecting them together. Just like classical computers have their “and” and “or” Boolean logic gates, quantum computers have “pauli operators,” “superposition” and “c-not” logic gates.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-5947 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer-1024x527.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer-300x155.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer-768x396.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer-1024x527.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/QuantumComputer.png 1262w\" alt=\"QuantumComputer\" width=\"625\" height=\"322\" /></p>\n<p>After I finished writing my quantum computing program, I used the composer to simulate the program, visualize the results and debug a program logic mistake I’d made. Now, for the really exciting part: finally, with a working quantum program, I used the composer to run my program on the IBM “real” five-qubit quantum processor. The quantum simulator and processor produced identical results.</p>\n<p>Just like other cloud services, quantum computing is pay-per-use. Initially, my account was loaded with six “units” or credits. One run of my program costs between three and five units. IBM replenished my account the day after I used up my units so I could continue to explore quantum computing.</p>\n<p>Now it’s your turn to imagine what’s possible.

To assist enterprises to receive function and product maintenance more quickly, a major change in the IBM® Software Support Lifecycle Policy is introduced.</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, IBM adds a new policy, known as the continuous delivery (CD) support model, for eligible, on-premise IBM software products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/GIF/ALET/OP351112.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"378\" align=\"middle\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The new support model is implemented as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The CD support model allows eligible, on-premise IBM products to make new function available more frequently. It is understood that frequent releases of the model may not be suitable for all client application environments. In those cases, some IBM products may offer a Long Term Support Release (LTSR) option.</li>\n<li>An LTSR is supported for a longer period of time, to assist clients where frequent functional updates may not be practical and a longer term deployment is more suitable. IBM may elect to declare any CD update package an LTSR.</li>\n<li>Both new function and product maintenance will be made available in a single, easy-to-install CD update package.</li>\n<li>Clients should stay current with the installation of CD update and LTSR packages to obtain the latest product maintenance and new function. Product defect fixes and security updates are only available for the two, most current CD update packages and all active LTSRs. If required, individual product fixes can be made available between CD update packages for resolution of problems.</li>\n<li>CD update packages are delivered on the latest product release stream when the new product release becomes available.</li>\n<li>New functional updates are not available to previously released CD update packages and LTSRs.</li>\n<li>Support is available for all IBM components of a product until the product is withdrawn from support. IBM expects clients will upgrade to either the latest CD update package or LTSR in order to receive on-going security updates and defect fixes.</li>\n<li>Support extensions are available, for a minimum period of one year for an additional fee, following the effective support discontinuance date of the product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new Software Support Lifecycle Policy delivers a consistent and predictable availability of support. Clients will continue to receive the same world-class support and assistance that they are accustomed to from IBM. This support is included in the standard Software Subscription and Support (S&amp;S), Software Maintenance (SWM), or Monthly License Charge (MLC) charges for the eligible product.</p>\n<p>By maintaining a current S&amp;S, SWM, MLC, or SupportLine agreement, clients will receive the maximum value for their software products and can take advantage of the CD support model.</p>\n<p>With the CD support model, IBM will deliver product technical support for at least two years, which starts at the availability of a new product version or release. IBM will also offer an optional, fee-based support extension for at least one additional year. This model is referred to as a 2 plus 1 (2+1) policy. This is a significant change from the existing Standard (3+2) and Enhanced (5+3) IBM software support policies. The existing Standard and Enhanced policies are not impacted by this announcement and will continue to be available. By maintaining S&amp;S, SWM, or MLC on their IBM software, clients receive the maximum value of their software products and can take full advantage of technology upgrades and enhancements quickly, based on their business requirements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/9/897/ENUS216-269/index.html&amp;lang=en&amp;request_locale=en\">Learn more</a></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/05/announcing-continuous-delivery-support-model-options-for-ibm-software/","date":"2016-05-24T12:00:42","modified":"2016-12-16T04:26:37","format":"standard","slug":"announcing-continuous-delivery-support-model-options-for-ibm-software","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32347","excerpt":"<p>In the cognitive era of computing, enterprises embrace three historic technology shifts to enhance the business value that are provided their clients: Big data Cloud computing Combination of social and mobile At the same time, the pace of business model innovation continues to accelerate to drive an increasing need and pace for delivery of new [&hellip;]</p>\n","menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America/New_York","date_gmt":"2016-05-24T16:00:42","modified_tz":"America/New_York","modified_gmt":"2016-12-16T09:26:37","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32347","author":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/27","collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts","replies":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32347/comments","version-history":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32347/revisions"}},"featured_image":null,"terms":{"category":[{"ID":667,"name":"DevOps","slug":"devops","description":"","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":26,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/category/devops/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/667"}}}]}},{"ID":32351,"title":"IBM API Connect adds on-demand consulting to help clients unleash APIs","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":27,"username":"deepthimc","name":"deepthimc","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"deepthimc","slug":"deepthimc","URL":"","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aaa3ca991a7e6b088a8b0d19f4522919?s=96","description":"","registered":"2016-12-07T14:05:45+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/27","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/27/posts"}}},"content":"<p>API Connect for Bluemix Dedicated now delivers consulting options that include API Connect On Demand Consulting, which is a revolutionary, On Demand Consulting model from IBM.

Today, IBM also made a range of announcements spanning technology and business consulting to rapidly advance the use of distributed ledger technology across multiple industries:</p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li><strong>New blockchain services on the IBM Cloud:</strong> New blockchain services help create and manage blockchain networks to power a new class of distributed ledger applications. Developers can create digital assets and accompanying business logic to more securely and privately transfer assets among members of a permissioned blockchain test network. Using IBM’s new blockchain services available on Bluemix, developers can access fully integrated DevOps tools for creating, deploying, running and monitoring blockchain applications on the IBM Cloud. Blockchain applications can also be deployed on IBM z Systems, enabling an additional level of security, availability and performance for handling sensitive and regulated data. Blockchain applications can access existing transactions on distributed servers and z Systems through APIs to support new payment, settlement, supply chain and business processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li><strong>Enabling Internet of Things (IoT) data on blockchain:</strong> Using its Watson IoT Platform, IBM will make it possible for information from devices such as RFID-based locations, barcode-scan events, or device-reported data to be used with IBM’s Blockchain. Devices will be able to communicate to blockchain-based ledgers to update or validate smart contracts. For example, as an IoT-connected package moves along multiple distribution points, the package location and temperature information could be updated on a blockchain. This allows all parties to share information and status of the package as it moves among multiple parties to ensure the terms of a contract are met.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li><strong> IBM Garages for blockchain app design and implementation: </strong>To help accelerate the design and development of blockchain applications, IBM Garages will open in London, New York, Singapore and Tokyo to enable IBM experts to collaborate with developers on the design and implementation of blockchain for business. IBM Global Business Services will also expand its blockchain consulting practice for clients in banking and financial services and logistics. IBM Interactive Experience (IBM iX), the largest global digital agency, will also engage clients to co-design new use cases for blockchain in more than 25 IBM Studios around the globe.</li>\n</ul>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/04/why-ibm-just-launched-secure-blockchain-services/","date":"2016-04-29T12:00:20","modified":"2016-12-15T11:34:35","format":"standard","slug":"why-ibm-just-launched-secure-blockchain-services","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32281","excerpt":"<p>ARMONK, N.Y. &#8211; 16 Feb 2016: To help developers quickly begin exploring the use of blockchain in the enterprise, IBM (NYSE: IBM) has made nearly 44,000 lines of code available to the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project to help developers easily build secure distributed ledgers that can be used to exchange most anything of [&hellip;]</p>\n","menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America/New_York","date_gmt":"2016-04-29T16:00:20","modified_tz":"America/New_York","modified_gmt":"2016-12-15T16:34:35","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32281","author":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/21","collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts","replies":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32281/comments","version-history":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/posts/32281/revisions"}},"featured_image":null,"terms":{"category":[{"ID":669,"name":"Blockchain","slug":"blockchain","description":"","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":5,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/category/blockchain/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/669"}}}]}},{"ID":32315,"title":"Connect and automate your business with IBM App Connect","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":21,"username":"debadat1","name":"Debarati Datta","first_name":"Debarati","last_name":"Datta","nickname":"debadat1","slug":"debadat1","URL":"","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/abb2f4b81e84dd828e7dc6af9da8dcf0?s=96","description":"","registered":"2016-12-07T13:55:43+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/21","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/wp-json/users/21/posts"}}},"content":"<h2>We’re living through an app explosion</h2>\n<p>Think about all of the applications lines of business rely on to get their work done: Customer relationship management (CRM) apps, marketing automation apps, social apps, sales and HR apps and more!

For example, last year the marketing technology landscape included more than 2000 vendors with tools across more than 40 categories.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5326 size-full\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan1.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan1.jpg 600w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan1-300x225.jpg 300w\" alt=\"app explosion graphic demonstrating the need for ibm app connect\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></p>\n<p>Organizations likely rely on hundreds or thousands of apps for their workers. Modern frameworks, patterns, and methodologies like microservices and APIs mean modern applications are more lightweight and more specialized. The app landscape has changed forever.</p>\n<p>The problem is, business professionals are often working harder getting their apps to work together than on delivering client value.</p>\n<p>A number of different apps need to work together to have an efficient workflow, but those apps don’t really talk to each other. They aren’t working together as a team the way teams are supposed to work. They don’t have the situational awareness to share data when required or to execute the right action at the right time. They aren’t working intelligently. People are spending far too much time on routine and manual tasks to get all of their apps working together instead of thinking, being creative, and delivering value to clients. For example, according to a recent <a href=\"http://ibm.co/1StYGAe\" target=\"_blank\">Hubspot survey</a>, the average marketer spends a third of their time completing repetitive tasks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5328\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2.jpg 2196w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2-768x536.jpg 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hasan2-1024x714.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"graphic demonstrating time spent on routine tasks from hubspot\" width=\"600\" height=\"419\" /></a></p>\n<p>A lot of tools lines of business use are probably cloud-based, but a lot of systems are behind the company firewall. If you’re an IT professional, you’re constantly battered with requests to get access to data in systems behind the firewall. If you’re a line-of-business user like a digital marketer, you are dependent on IT to get work done, and IT has to manage all of the requests that come their way and manage all the applications used both in the cloud and on premises.</p>\n<p><strong>How do we get our tools to work better together?</strong></p>\n<p>How do we get more value out of our data by maintaining consistency across the set of tools we use everyday? How do we automate tedious, routine tasks so we can spend more time on creating value for our company? As the sophistication of our roles increases, are we concerned about adopting yet another tool because we don’t know whether or not it will talk to our existing systems and tools?</p>\n<p><strong>To survive in this app landscape, we need a solution that empowers us</strong></p>\n<p>We need a solution that lets us become an agent of change in our organizations–delivering value on the spot as we recognize opportunities to instrument how our applications work together to deliver greater business value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ibm.co/1WemYRh\" target=\"_blank\">IBM App Connect</a> is a new solution announced at InterConnect 2016.

To maintain support, clients on this continuous delivery model will need to keep their IBM MQ environment up-to-date with the continuous delivery of modification levels rather than the long term support fixpacks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/3/897/ENUS216-153/index.html&amp;lang=en&amp;request_locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more.</a></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/04/announcing-enhancements-to-ibm-mq-that-help-you-master-messaging/","date":"2016-04-19T12:00:45","modified":"2016-12-16T04:39:07","format":"standard","slug":"announcing-enhancements-to-ibm-mq-that-help-you-master-messaging","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32085","excerpt":"<p>IBM MQ V9.0 for multiplatforms is a robust and secure messaging middleware offeringthat allows applications, systems, services, and files to exchange data rapidly and reliably.

The answer was a resounding yes – since its launch on March 9, the app has been downloaded approximately 75,000 times and the included consent form has been filled out by 40,000 participants so far.</em></p>\n<p><em>Stanford Medicine’s <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/myheartcounts.html\">MyHeart Counts</a> was one of five demonstration apps involved in Apple’s launch of its <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2015/04/apples-medical-checkup-researchkit-adds-momentum-around-securely-storing-medical-data-in-the-cloud/\">Research Kit</a>, designed to further medical research by leveraging mobile and wearable devices for input and storing medical information in the cloud, where researchers can share findings. </em><strong>Thoughts on Cloud</strong><em> talked with Dr. Alan Yeung, MD, the Li Ka Shing Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford, about how the convenience of mobile devices and ubiquity of cloud storage could change the face of medical research. </em></p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud:</strong> With Stanford’s heart-health study, you’ve seen record involvement in a very short amount of time. Did this surprise you?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeung:</strong> Generally when you do clinical research you may get one in five or one in 10 people to sign the consent form, because the form is so long.  So our first question was, can consent be obtained on a device? It had never been done before.</p>\n<p>We were one of five demonstration apps that Apple launched to show that this type of research is possible and feasible, because in the beginning no one knows for sure if anyone would open up these kinds of apps and download them. The other four apps (studying breast cancer, Parkinson’s, asthma, and diabetes) are targeted toward people with the disease, but our app is targeted at everybody. It checks cardiovascular health to see if we can measure physical activity or lack of physical activity, how it relates to heart health, and [the effects of] modifying behavior. So the first thing we are doing is trying to measure some baselines with people – are they willing to sign a consent form, go through basic questionnaires, and enter some data? The answer is yes – people are willing to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud:</strong> <strong>How are you storing the data? Are there concerns about privacy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yeung:</strong> We’re being very careful. With Apple’s ResearchKit all the data sits on the survey subject’s phone, and they can choose to turn it off any time. We only upload the identified data from their phone (at which point subjects’ names are removed and replaced by random code to protect privacy) and we store it on a secure server run by Sage Bionetworks, so we never really see the data from the people.</p>\n<p>Right now Sage is the common ground for everybody to share data, they have that capability so they’re [storing data] for everyone. If an institution doesn’t have the back end they can continue to use Sage, but those that have enough apps and research will want to have their own back end and  then upload the analysis results to Sage, because it will be faster.</p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud: Does Stanford Medicine have the infrastructure to store survey data?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yeung:</strong> We didn’t have it when we started this app; there are legal issues, security issues, privacy issues. We are building the capability and hopefully we’ll be able to get data from subjects’ phones, analyze it and send the results to Sage.</p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud:</strong> In addition to the issues around getting your own infrastructure set up to store data, what kind of challenges does this type of medical research face?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeung:</strong> We don’t have all the legal issues resolves for an international launch, there are issues with data crossing borders. So for now we are limited to the US.</p>\n<p><strong>ThoughtsOnCloud:</strong> <strong>How has your app demonstrated that medical research can be advanced by this type of study?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yeung: </strong>One of the advancements in research capabilities it brings is providing a tool for anyone who wants to build an (electronic) consent form – the tools are now there for any group to get consent using a mobile device. That’s really helpful to know.</p>\n<p>Right now we are downloading the data to do analysis and establish baselines. In just a little less than two months we have data on a large number of patients, and hopefully we can write a paper in the next couple of weeks. I call that speed unknown to mankind when it comes to clinical research, because clinical research always has a long lead time and by the time something is published, something else has come up. Here you can do something relatively rough – some of the questions in our study aren’t deep, but they’re done on a large number of patients so you get generalized observations. And with this type of study you can reach people all over the US in a very short amount of time.</p>\n<p>This type of research is so much faster, so you get a good sense of what the baseline is, then you can do more detailed, traditional research. So it will replace certain types of research, but it’s not going to replace all types of research. It’s a new way to get a lot of information quickly.<br />\n<img src=\"https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/conv/?adv=z8lo6ws&amp;ct=0:z73koya&amp;fmt=3\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/04/race-for-the-cure-mobile-devices-and-cloud-storage-speed-medical-research/","date":"2016-04-04T12:00:26","modified":"2016-12-16T05:04:03","format":"standard","slug":"race-cure-mobile-devices-cloud-storage-speed-medical-research","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32969","excerpt":"<p>When the Stanford University School of Medicine launched a cardiovascular study that uses an iPhone app to collect data from subjects and stores information in the cloud, the first question researchers were looking to answer was whether people would use it.

Under the leadership of Michael Fraenkel, IBM’s distinguished engineer in Cloud Foundry, we’ve created a space where local IBM Cloud developers who are experts in Cloud Foundry are training fellow software developers—regardless of company or affiliation—to become dedicated “committers” for the Cloud Foundry project.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5488\" src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dojo-1-300x225.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dojo-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dojo-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dojo-1-1024x768.jpeg 1024w\" alt=\"Dojo 1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></p>\n<p>Why is this a big deal?</p>\n<p>When developers help developers, it translates to accelerated innovation. This new learning space serves as a training ground for aspiring Cloud Foundry developers, while simultaneously driving new innovation and continuous improvement to Cloud Foundry open source projects. The entire open source developer ecosystem—adopters and contributors alike—can benefit from a growing base of skilled Cloud Foundry developers and the increased pace of innovation thanks to shared code.</p>\n<p>Additionally, because Cloud Foundry is at the core of IBM’s cloud platform, <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/\">Bluemix</a> has rapidly grown to become the largest public Cloud Foundry deployment in the world. It features more than 140 tools and services spanning areas like big data, mobile, Watson, analytics, integration, DevOps, security and the Internet of Things and draws more than 20,000 new developers per week who are creating more than 120,000 apps every month. The dojo increases the pace of innovation on the Bluemix platform, which benefits the growing community of developers on IBM Cloud.</p>\n<p>The dojo also provides a unique environment that dramatically reduces the time it takes for coders to reach Cloud Foundry “committer” status. Students pair up for intense, hands-on training for only 6-12 weeks and graduates can take the skills they learned in the dojo and immediately put them to use within Cloud Foundry projects and their organizations.</p>\n<p>It’s not only a coup for IBM and Cloud Foundry. The RTP area will benefit from the project, too. Julie Terry, Special Projects Manager for The Research Triangle Park, explains why it’s such an important step forward for the area:</p>\n<p>“We’re really excited to have the IBM Cloud Foundry Dojo at The Frontier here in Research Triangle Park. When The Frontier opened a year ago, our team had hopes that it would become a convening point for all kinds of people with varied interests. Through our partnership with IBM, coders and cloud evangelists will have the opportunity to mingle with artists and nonprofit leaders. The best kind of change occurs when different minds start working together, and that’s exactly what we hope happens as the dojo continues to become an established part of The Frontier community.”</p>\n<p>I’ve been working with Cloud Foundry Foundation CEO Sam Ramji since the organization’s inception. In that time, I’ve watched Cloud Foundry become an indispensable platform for the developer, by the developer. It allows developers to use any language they want and deploy across many clouds. Sam Ramji explains why dojos are such an effective way to build a critical mass of software coders developing innovative applications on Cloud Foundry:</p>\n<p>“The dojo method provides a truly immersive approach to learning the process and methodology required to become a Cloud Foundry Committer. By ensuring developers are educated on continuous innovation and paired programming, the dojo helps ensure a culture and skills match for full-time committers to the project.”</p>\n<p>If you’re in the RTP area and want to attend our launch party, I encourage you to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rtp-cloud-foundry-dojo-launch-event-tickets-20974360878\">register and join us for this event</a>.

Well, after spending the past two days at the IBM InterConnect Conference in Las Vegas, hybrid cloud has been at the forefront of every conversation.</p>\n<p>Hybrid cloud has emerged as the cornerstone for digital transformation, enabling developers to up their ante by creating mobile, IoT and other client engagement applications that connect to enterprise data and services, delivering unique and compelling customer experiences without starting from scratch.  Sounds like a long shot with low odds? Well, it’s now easier than you think.</p>\n<p>IBM announced a new series of Connect Offerings for IBM Cloud to help businesses unlock the value of their existing applications, data and services by connecting them to and from the cloud.   In short, these new offerings fundamentally transform how you can extend your IT investments and capabilities with hybrid cloud.</p>\n<p>IBM’s entire software platform portfolio is now available on the cloud via public, private, or on-premises delivery models, with easy on-ramps to hybrid cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>Marie Wieck, General Manager of IBM Cloud Application Services said, “The power of cloud based applications is that you can easily represent both real time information and the collective knowledge on any topic. That’s always going to be a combination of newly created services and existing apps, many of which exist on-premises.”</p>\n<p>These new offerings allow clients to do just that, unlock the value of their billion dollar IT investments through a hybrid cloud approach, creating new cloud-native applications that connect to existing on-premises applications and data.</p>\n<p>At the core of IBM’s new offerings is WebSphere Connect, a set of hybrid cloud capabilities leveraging cloud services and APIs to enhance applications, whether cloud-native or on-premises.  These new capabilities allow developers to expose enterprise data and services as APIs, and connect to and from the cloud to enhance existing on-premises applications with innovative cloud services, like cognitive computing capabilities from IBM Watson and operational services providing performance insights.</p>\n<p>Now developers can leverage their existing skills to expose, create and connect applications leveraging IBM’s Bluemix cloud platform.  Ultimately, these capabilities help businesses optimize costs, reduce time to market and extend the value of critical enterprise data and services eliminating costly “rip and replace” strategies that are always a losing bet.</p>\n<p><strong>The API economy</strong></p>\n<p>Tied to any conversation about applications at InterConnect are APIs (“Application Programming Interfaces”).  APIs are a hot topic that has been discussed in detail throughout the conference and their influence on the emerging <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/middleware/integration/en-us/api-economy.html\">API economy</a>. Businesses of all sizes are seeing the benefits of monetizing APIs to capitalize on this economy by offering them as services through mobile, web and cloud channels creating new revenue sources and broadening their reach to new markets.</p>\n<p>APIs make it quick and cost-effective for businesses to create interfaces between back-end systems and front-end applications so new digital services can get to market faster. A part of the new Connect Offerings for IBM Cloud is API Connect, an end to end API lifecycle offering which allows any client to create, test, publish and manage APIs — making it easy to find, call, connect and consume APIs through cloud.  API Connect also enables automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance.  A first of its kind offering with powerful capabilities for both Developers and IT Operation management teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Application delivery</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong>Finally, making sure you can move your applications where they provide the most value for your business gives you the ultimate winning hand.  Delivering applications fast while maintaining a secure, scalable, high performance environment is the trick.  Hybrid cloud means that you need seamless portability across any environment and new capabilities from PureApplication make this even easier.  New Open Patterns beta, and Bluemix Local make automating workload portability easier by defining repeatable, dependable and secure patterns to achieve the flexibility to deploy where and when it works best for your business.</p>\n<p>As hybrid cloud adoption (another winning bet placed for the mention of “hybrid cloud”) continues to grow, organizations have a wealth of capabilities to unlock the value of their existing application investments while innovating on the cloud.  To learn more, read IBM’s recent <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49155.wss\">press announcement</a>.<strong><em><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you’re in attendance this week, be sure to network and share your experience at the conference using hashtags #IBMInterConnect, #WebSphere, #PureApp, or #IBMDevOps.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/02/easy-on-ramps-to-hybrid-cloud-are-the-best-bet-in-vegas/","date":"2016-02-25T12:00:05","modified":"2016-12-16T05:03:01","format":"standard","slug":"easy-ramps-hybrid-cloud-best-bet-vegas","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32953","excerpt":"<p>Maybe I’m in the Las Vegas spirit, but if I were a betting man, I’d bet a dollar every time I heard someone say “hybrid cloud” and undoubtedly, I’d hit the jackpot.  Why?

IBM’s Center for Applied Insight recently found that 85 percent of leading hybrid cloud adopters report that hybrid cloud is accelerating digital transformation in their organization.</p>\n<p>But IBM’s message isn’t just that hybrid is the way forward. A hybrid cloud is only as good as the open technology that supports it.</p>\n<p>If Sunday’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joeweinman/status/701592014639353856\">standing-room-only</a> crowd at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IBMOTS&amp;src=typd\">IBM Open Technology Summit</a> (OTS) is any indication, the enthusiasm surrounding open tech is stronger than ever.</p>\n<p>A registered crowd of more than 1,400 packed the room to hear from IBM executives and external open technology stakeholders like Cloud Foundry Foundation CEO Sam Ramji and OpenStack Foundation executive director Jonathan Bryce.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the OTS on Sunday, LeBlanc, who pioneered IBM’s commitment to open 20 years ago, called open technology “the foundation of the next generation of cloud.”</p>\n<p><strong>No one wants cloud molasses</strong></p>\n<p>Dr. Angel Diaz, IBM vice president of Cloud Technology &amp; Architecture, has long maintained that if you’re not building your cloud ecosystem with open technology, you’re building “a dead-end cloud.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://images3.newscred.com/Zz0zOTBmZmY4YzI2MGFiMWViMDhhMDRkNTcwYTc0Y2UyMg==\" alt=\"Angel Diaz at Open Tech Summit.png\" width=\"310\" height=\"233\" /></p>\n<p>Consider an instance where a team decides to build an application while working with a system that has a single source for infrastructure. If that team has to tap into proprietary APIs, proprietary middleware, Diaz insists the team will inevitably find themselves stuck with little to no options.</p>\n<p>“[In this scenario] you simply cannot extend your cloud,” Diaz says. “You’re living in the molasses of cloud.”</p>\n<p>The solution? Partner with a vendor who uses open technology across their infrastructure, platform, APIs, solutions and services.</p>\n<p>“That gives you choice and consistency on-prem and off-prem,” Diaz says.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice is power</strong></p>\n<p>IBM Fellow and chief technology officer of Cloud Platform Services Jerry Cuomo says “open by design” is more than a slogan—it’s a commitment to open technology that’s providing users with what he calls “freedom of action.”</p>\n<p>“You want to be able to work where there’s a grand resource pool that you can choose from,” Cuomo says. “A CIO working with a vendor that is open has choice. Choice brings freedom. Freedom brings power. Power brings acceleration—the ability to get your job done in an amazing way to delight your end users.”</p>\n<p><strong>An industry perspective</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong>Tim Crawford, CIO Strategic Advisor for AVOA, says that every customer is looking for something different. As those customers go through the process moving from current state to future state—and where hybrid fits into that journey—their needs will vary and evolve over time.</p>\n<p>“At some point in the journey, everybody could benefit from some component of open,” Crawford says. “I think it will show up and manifest itself at different stages as they go through that process.”</p>\n<p><em>To learn more about IBM’s open technology offerings, visit </em><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/open/\"><em>developerWorks Open</em></a><em> and the </em><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/architecture/\"><em>IBM Cloud Architecture Center</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/02/open-technology-the-key-to-an-effective-hybrid-cloud/","date":"2016-02-23T12:00:59","modified":"2016-12-16T05:02:20","format":"standard","slug":"open-technology-key-effective-hybrid-cloud","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32941","excerpt":"<p>At IBM InterConnect 2016, hybrid cloud is everywhere.

Eighty percent of businesses are leveraging cloud as a key ingredient to do just that.</p>\n<p>While some say businesses must start from scratch or move everything to the cloud, we believe there is a better choice. Hybrid cloud is key to digital innovation. IBM offers clients choice with consistency to seamlessly integrate both traditional IT and cloud services that will deliver benefits their businesses’ needs.  This is why IBM is #1 in hybrid cloud.(1)</p>\n<p>On Monday, IBM made this even easier with a range of <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49155.wss\">new announcements</a> that accelerate hybrid cloud adoption.  Based on engagement with over 500 clients leveraging hybrid cloud, we have discovered the three most common on ramps to hybrid cloud and have enhanced our products and our services partnerships to speed these journeys. As organizations leverage hybrid cloud to deliver digital business models, they most often cite these business goals.  They want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create</strong> new compelling solutions at speed</li>\n<li><strong>Connect</strong> their existing capabilities to the cloud for the broadest reach</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize</strong> their operations and service delivery to scale to meet demand</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s dive into each of these a bit more on how we can help reach those goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating new compelling solutions at speed</strong></p>\n<p>To foster innovation and optimize the customer experience, it is critical that new cloud apps can be rapidly built, deployed, improved and connected to existing servers with agile DevOps.  Developers need the choice of runtimes supporting the broadest range of languages to maximize their productivity with access to the most innovative services. IT managers need a platform to deploy these at scale with the instrumentation to monitor adoption. IBM Bluemix is that platform for hybrid innovation, and we just added a host of new Bluemix services, like new Watson services with cognitive APIs, OpenWhisk, and Blockchain DevOps services.</p>\n<p>With tools and runtimes support for Node.js, Java, Swift and .NET, IBM Bluemix is a one-stop shop developers want. With a new Github partnership, this got even better. If you need help getting started, our Bluemix garages are the perfect place to go.</p>\n<p><strong>Connect the billions of dollars invested in enterprise IT with new cloud services</strong></p>\n<p>Creating apps is important but it’s equally important that existing apps and data can be effortlessly published and consumed for innovation and monetization. This is where the new series of Connect offerings for IBM Cloud come into play. IBM has introduced WebSphere Connect to easily cloud-enabled WebSphere apps by accessing cloud services direct from on-premise middleware. With more than 250 million global instances of WebSphere, IBM’s middleware portfolio touches approximately 80 percent of all global transactions.</p>\n<p>Now all WebSphere clients will be able to access new feature updates directly from the cloud. This exciting announcement includes other key IBM products: API Connect, App Connect, DataWorks, Websphere Blockchain Connect and zOS Connect.</p>\n<p>For hybrid cloud solutions to work, backend data and customer-facing applications need to be connected to each other from anywhere. By delivering these Connect products on the IBM Cloud to link the enterprise to the cloud, developers and business leaders have the best of both worlds opening up limitless possibilities for the broadest ecosystem access.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Optimize operations to scale</strong></p>\n<p>Optimizing workloads across cloud and traditional IT gives disruptors choice with consistency and the freedom to choose which environment is the best fit for their needs. With our hybrid cloud management capabilities and our PureApp Service on SoftLayer, portability and growth of these workloads is available for public, dedicated or local clouds. We just made this even easier with our new partnership with VMware,making IBM the top choice for hybrid cloud.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which on-ramp you take to hybrid cloud, it is increasingly evident that businesses want the flexibility and choice that only IBM Cloud can offer.  With our new suite of Connect offerings, integrating on premise systems to cloud solutions has never been simpler.

According to a recent CIO article,(1) in a study of 930 IT professionals, 88% are using public cloud technology and 63% are using private cloud. A whopping 82% have a hybrid cloud strategy, which is up from 74% in 2014, evidence that this is a phenomenon that is here to stay.</p>\n<p>It is no longer a question of when a company will move to the cloud, but how. How does a business reconcile existing IT infrastructure and applications into a cloud model without sacrificing security, reliability and speed? How do businesses increase revenue while maintaining a seamless customer experience?</p>\n<p>The key challenges that drive our clients to move to a cloud model are similar across industries and organizations. These include the desire to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deliver</strong> a flexible consumption model across all environments</li>\n<li><strong>Unlock</strong> the billions of dollars invested in apps and data that exist in the enterprise by exposing them as APIs for enterprise integration</li>\n<li><strong>Differentiate</strong> with data and improve the ability to provide insight from it</li>\n<li><strong>Provide </strong>deeper customer engagement and understanding of how to extract value from dark data</li>\n<li><strong>Accelerate</strong> the creation of new products, services and business models</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’re seeing a pattern with many of today’s fastest growing, and most innovative companies. In an effort to create new revenue streams, and drive new customers, they are relying on APIs more than ever. It is predicted that 80% of large global enterprises will offer public web APIs by 2017.(2) But to make this a reality, to drive real business value, requires an API strategy built on a hybrid cloud.  When done right, those same leaders tend to see better client engagement and loyalty because they have visibility into each transaction, every application, and use data to make nearly every decision. In order to reap these types of benefits from hybrid cloud, enterprises need a strategic approach for integrating all of the APIs, applications, databases in public, private and hybrid environments across the business,</p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that IBM is all in on the hybrid cloud of the future. Now, with 100% of IBM’s enterprise software available on-premise and in the cloud, we’re helping companies of all sizes take advantage of the choice and flexibility that the hybrid cloud provides them.</p>\n<p>Today, we are announcing an exciting new series of “Connect” offerings for IBM Cloud to ease and improve the transition to a hybrid model. This new series of offerings will extend IBM’s leading middleware capabilities in the cloud. This gives existing clients a rapid path to hybrid, while also attracting new buyers with the most comprehensive set of hybrid integration technologies – delivered through a flexible consumption and pricing model.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images2.newscred.com/Zz1hZGE4NmI3YjNkZWQ3MDczZjQ3MzNkYWFjOWI0MGZlZA==\" alt=\"MWblog.png\" width=\"824\" height=\"215\" /></p>\n<p>IBM has been the application and middleware leader for 14 consecutive years, with 29% market share, outpacing the competition by more than two times, according to Gartner, based on total worldwide revenue for 2014.(3) Combined with a powerful cloud platform, IBM’s expertise in complex integration is paying off as digital enterprises move to the cloud.</p>\n<p>With over 100,000 enterprises using IBM’s on-premise capabilities today, businesses can realize immediate benefits from having greater choice and flexibility by leveraging these new offerings to create their ideal hybrid cloud solution.</p>\n<p>One immediate benefit of the pay-as-you-go model is cost savings. Many businesses are <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/application-server-on-cloud/us/en-us\">saving up to 30%</a> or more when moving their applications to the cloud.  Cost savings and a platform ideal for developing next-generation Java apps with microservices and APIs makes for a combination that is hard to beat.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how hybrid cloud and how the new series of “Connect” offerings can aid you in your cloud journey, read the <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49155.wss\">press release</a> and explore what IBM Cloud has to offer <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/solutions/middleware/index.html?cmp=IBMSocial&amp;ct=C43202QW&amp;cm=h&amp;IIO=BSYS&amp;csr=twitter&amp;cr=casyst&amp;ccy=us\">here</a>.</p>\n<hr width=\"800\" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CIO.com, “<a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/3018156/cloud-computing/cloud-adoption-soars-but-integration-challenges-remain.html\">Cloud adoption soars, but integration challenges remain”</a>, January 2016</li>\n<li>Gartner, Hype Cycle for Application Development, 2015, G00277761</li>\n<li>Market Share for All Software Markets, Worldwide, 2014, Gartner, 31 March 2015, G00273284</li>\n</ol>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/02/unlocking-billions-of-dollars-with-hybrid-cloud/","date":"2016-02-22T12:00:24","modified":"2016-12-16T05:15:49","format":"standard","slug":"unlocking-billions-dollars-hybrid-cloud","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32933","excerpt":"<p>As we move into 2016, it has become apparent that cloud is at a tipping point.

In the latest OMNIbus Integrations release, support for Juniper’s Contrail products has been added. This builds on top of the support for CISCO APIC that was announced in 2015. The production of a dedicated probe for Contrail allows Operations Insight users to manage their Juniper NFV deployment consistently with their existing network.

This move aims to make it easier for developers to unlock the valuable data, knowledge and transaction systems, such as supply chain, inventory management systems and detailed customer records, at the center of global business.</p>\n<p>According to IBM’s Center for Applied Insights global study of 500 cloud decisions makers, organizations are increasingly integrating cloud resources with traditional IT to accommodate dynamic needs and specific business priorities.1 The mix will continue to shift as companies grow their use of private and public cloud to manage dynamic and increasingly digital business priorities. Further, a report from IDC states that over 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud architectures by 2017.2</p>\n<p>At the heart of these transformational shifts are developers, a population expected to top 25 million by 20203, who are charged with building new cloud frameworks and coding new products, apps and services.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating on-premises data and applications.  To meet these demands, IBM unveiled a new series of “Connect” offerings for IBM Cloud that will fundamentally transform how enterprise clients extend their existing IT investments and capabilities to the Cloud. To allow for this strategic transformation, IBM&#8217;s software is now available on the cloud via public, private or on-premises delivery models.  Delivered as an easy to consume cloud service, developers can connect applications and data sources together, no matter where they reside.</p>\n<p>Core to this announcement is IBM WebSphere Connect, which extends IBM&#8217;s industry leading WebSphere portfolio to the cloud. With more than 200 million global licenses of WebSphere, IBM&#8217;s middleware portfolio is the leading platform for Java EE.  Today’s news will make it easier for the estimated 13 million Java developers worldwide to connect their apps to the cloud, and continue to extend WebSphere to a whole new community of node.js and Swift developers4.  Moving forward, WebSphere clients can access new features from the IBM Cloud.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Businesses are adopting cloud based applications to accelerate innovation, but they are still struggling to combine those cloud native services with existing apps and data which reside on-premises,” said Marie Wieck, general manager, IBM Cloud Application Services. “Our objective is to drastically simplify how developers discover and connect disparate apps and services, so enterprises can unlock the value of their existing IT and more rapidly capture the value of the cloud. This helps enable developers to discover and re-use the best capabilities, where ever they reside.”</p>\n<p>For example, the Expert Tech MobileFirst for iOS app built by IBM helps field service technician solve complex problems or tough questions on the spot. While the app is very simple to use, it can draw on 12 existing back-end systems, such as content management, customer relationship management, vehicle management and inventory management, that can run on WebSphere to provide the necessary information. For the average developer, such as one fresh out of school, a data source or system that might provide the customer with a better experience or help them to gain a better answer, needs to be easily discoverable and usable. With today&#8217;s news, IBM is making data or systems easy to consume over the cloud, whether it actually resides on the cloud or not.</p>\n<p>Starting immediately, the enterprises currently using IBM’s on-premises software can use these new offerings as on ramp to hybrid cloud, to realize the immediate benefits and new value from their existing investments.</p>\n<p>In addition to IBM WebSphere connect, the other new “Connect” offerings for IBM Cloud include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API Connect &#8211; This first-of-kind service allows any client to publish its IT as an API –making it easy to find, call and connect over the cloud. Additionally, it helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance.</li>\n<li>App Connect &#8211; A new software-as-a-service offering that provides hundreds of pre-built connections to cloud and on-premises applications designed to help line-of-business professionals speed through integration tasks.<br />\nMessage Connect &#8211; A new Bluemix service that connects IBM Messaging portfolio to the Bluemix Message Hub services creating a true hybrid messaging offering.</li>\n<li>DataWorks &#8211; Based on the leading open source analytics project, Apache Spark, DataWorks is a service that can enable analysts, developers, data scientists and data engineers to prepare and move data from on premises and off premises to an analytics cloud ecosystem where it can be quickly analyzed and visualized.</li>\n<li>IBM WebSphere Blockchain Connect &#8211; A new service available to all WebSphere clients that is designed to provide a safe and encrypted passage from their blockchain cloud to their enterprise.<br />\nIBM z/OS Connect &#8211; A new version of the offering that creates APIs and RESTful interfaces for all apps running on IBM z Systems, connecting data and apps sitting on the mainframe with the cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about how migrating middleware to the cloud just got easier, visit here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Source: IBM Center for Applied Insights, Growing up Hybrid, 2016</li>\n<li>Source: IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Cloud 2016 Predictions – Mastering the Raw Material of Digital Transformation, Doc #259840</li>\n<li>Source: Global Developer Population and Demographic Study Volume 2, 2015</li>\n<li>Source: Global Developer Population and Demographic Study Volume I, 2015</li>\n</ol>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/2016/02/ibm-moves-to-unlock-billions-of-dollars-in-it-value-for-cloud-developers/","date":"2016-02-16T12:00:41","modified":"2016-12-16T04:41:22","format":"standard","slug":"ibm-moves-to-unlock-billions-of-dollars-in-it-value-for-cloud-developers","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=31997","excerpt":"<p>Las Vegas &#8211; IBM INTERCONNECT 2016 &#8211; 22 Feb 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it is extending its pervasive software platform to the cloud, helping enable clients to connect to data, application or transaction system.

It is becoming clear that video can help businesses meet these needs. Video overcomes the physical inhibitors present in the real world while leveraging the benefits of the digital world. It shortens the time to insights while eliminating the challenge of distance.</p>\n<p>As we enter the cognitive era, speed matters. Business systems are challenged by the requirement to rapidly gain insight about all their users, both internal and external. These systems must adapt in real time, to immediately learn from those insights, and to swiftly respond. By leveraging global Cloud architectures, businesses can provide agile and scalable platforms that connect immediately with people all over the world. And, increasingly that connection will be ‘video’.</p>\n<p>With video emerging as the world’s dominant data type, live video provides an immediacy and impact that can transform the way we entertain, learn, communicate and relate. In a recent survey of millennials, ages 18-29, over 70% use a streaming service.* So it is no surprise that services that offer real-time, live video are transforming the way that value is created. Today, IBM announced the acquisition of Ustream, yet again expanding the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/ustream\">IBM Cloud platform</a> to enable solutions and services that can deliver streaming video on a global scale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/ustream/\">Ustream</a> provides a cloud-based service that combines live video encoding and streaming, multi-device support, and the performance and scalability to serve millions of viewers. Ustream’s video service APIs will allow IBM to provide distinct, composable, video services through IBM Bluemix, enabling cloud developers to build new video applications or utilize video within their existing applications.</p>\n<p>Ustream services can help businesses in all industries capture opportunities in a rapidly changing marketplace – using real-time, live video to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Align employees with the business with effective tools for education, training, and internal communications</li>\n<li>Expand reach by generating demand for new offerings, products and services.</li>\n<li>Offer professional quality broadcasts for events to a global audience of employees, customers and/or partners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Ustream, businesses can rapidly exploit the power of video in traditional applications, such as news, education, live streaming of events – product launches and signature events – and deliver  new value in emerging and innovative applications, like telemedicine, public safety and  surveillance.  With Ustream and IBM Cloud, business can make video available globally, on a reliable, and scalable platform.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/\">Ustream</a>.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/01/real-time-cloud-based-video-on-rise/","date":"2016-01-27T12:00:15","modified":"2016-12-16T05:00:21","format":"standard","slug":"real-time-cloud-based-video-rise","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-announcements/?p=32929","excerpt":"<p>Each day we each experience the power of real-time video – to inform us, to educate us, to entertain us and to connect us to each other.

better tools, new SDKs, new services, cognitive computing, etc&#8230; They&#8217;re all new ways to make tasks more efficient, more scalable, or just simply easier to get things done.</p>\n<p>On that note, I&#8217;d like to introduce you to some new command line tools for interacting with IBM Watson services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-visual-recognition-utils\">Command Line Interface for Watson Visual Recognition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-speech-to-text-utils\">Command Line Interface for Watson Speech To Text</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both are command line utilities that make the task of training and interacting with the services easier for developers, and more efficient for iterative development.  To install them, first make sure that you have <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">Node.js</a> installed, and then you can install both using the <code>npm</code> command:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">npm install watson-visual-recognition-utils -g</pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">npm install watson-speech-to-text-utils -g</pre>\n<h2>CLI for Watson Visual Recognition</h2>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s examine the CLI for Watson Visual Recognition.  This enables you to quickly and easily interact with the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html\">Watson Visual Recognition service</a>, which is is a powerful tool that enables you to leverage cognitive computer vision to extract information from any image.  You can even use ‘custom classifiers’ to train the Watson service to recognize specific items or conditions of your choosing.   The command line utility gives you a simple, 1-step process for managing custom classifiers and invoking the classification service.   Just open up a terminal, invoke the <code>watson-visual-recognition-utils</code> command, and specify the images you either want to train or classify:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">$ watson-visual-recognition-utils\r\nWatson Visual Recognition - Custom Classifier Utilities\r\n \r\n  Usage:  &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; [options]\r\n \r\n \r\n  Commands:\r\n \r\n    api-usage [options]             View IBM Watson Visual Recognition API Key usage and limits\r\n    classifier-list [options]       List all custom classifiers\r\n    classifier-detail [options]     Fetch custom classifier verbose details\r\n    classifier-classify [options]   Classify an image\r\n    classifier-create [options]     Create a new custom classifier\r\n    classifier-delete [options]     Delete a custom classifier\r\n    key-set &lt;key&gt;;

We talked about it in this previous <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/11/bluemix-cloud-foundry-upgrading-dea-diego-architecture/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>, and now the next phase is complete. The reasons for this update are numerous and the benefits are significant.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade Complete</h2>\n<p>Upgrading the world&#8217;s largest Cloud Foundry platform had to be done with care and forethought, and many people in IBM Bluemix made it happen. Our team transitioned all the public environments to Diego and made that the default deployment target, so new apps that are pushed will deploy to a Diego cell.

/>Since we made Compose-hosted databases for Bluemix available, we&#8217;ve seen Bluemix users opening up the catalog to the benefits of hosted and managed Compose for MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, RethinkDB, etcd and RabbitMQ. There&#8217;s now two more databases to add to that list: Compose for MySQL, probably the most popular SQL database in the world; and ScyllaDB, a high-performance Cassandra-compatible database. Each of these new options brings new capabilities to the application stacks that developers can deploy.</p>\n<h2>Compose for MySQL (beta)</h2>\n<p>MySQL is probably the most popular open source relational database in the world; it debuted in 1995 and rapidly became an essential part of the internet&#8217;s infrastructure as a component of the LAMP stack. Since then it&#8217;s been constantly evolving under different owners. With a broad subset of ANSI SQL 99 and a wide set of its own extensions, including JSON document, full-text search, and updatable views, MySQL offers a rich palette for developers to draw on in their applications. Administrators will also find a wide selection of database management tools that can work with MySQL.</p>\n<h2>Compose for ScyllaDB (beta)</h2>\n<p>ScyllaDB is a highly performant, in-place replacement for the Cassandra wide-column distributed database. ScyllaDB is written in C++, rather than Cassandra&#8217;s Java, for better resource usage that can result in ten times better performance in benchmarks. Whilst retaining compatibility with Cassandra tool and data files, ScyllaDB adds self-tuning capabilities.</p>\n<p>As with all Compose databases, IBM Compose makes them even better by taking care of the management for you. This includes offering an easy, auto-scaling deployment system which delivers high availability and redundancy, automated no-stop backups and much more.</p>\n<h2>Compose for RabbitMQ</h2>\n<p>Also, we&#8217;d like to announce the promotion of RabbitMQ from beta to top table status, ready and complete for all production demands. The messaging platform is an essential complement to decoupled applications that distribute workloads.</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-blogcta-_-RegisterforBluemix\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for Bluemix.

width=\"133\" height=\"133\" />Hear ye, hear ye! The Bluemix Key Protect encryption key management service on the Dallas region Bluemix Public PaaS platform went live on December 21, 2016 to general availability (GA), with a new standard pricing plan for production use.</p>\n<h2>From beta to GA</h2>\n<p>If you are a beta user, you will not need to migrate your service instances. However, you will need to accept the new service plan. The new GA standard service plan is based on usage, with the following metric charge: keys used per month across all instances.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<h3>End of Beta Date: December 21, 2016</h3>\n<p>Beta users will not be able to create new Key Protect beta instances. Any Key Protect beta instances and beta keys still provisioned as of the End of Beta Support Date (see below) will be deleted if the keys are not converted to the GA standard plan.</p>\n<h3>End of Beta Support Date: January 21, 2017</h3>\n<p>As of January 21, 2017, you will no longer be able to provision new Key Protect beta keys. Existing keys must be converted to a GA standard pricing plan. Any instance still provisioned as of the End of Beta Support Date will be deleted if the keys are not converted to the GA standard plan. We recommend that users move to the GA standard plan by January 21, 2017 to ensure continued access to existing service instances and associated encryption keys.</p>\n<p>If you do not plan to enroll in the GA standard plan, please ensure that your keys and instances are removed by January 21, 2017.</p>\n<h2>Get familiar with Key Protect</h2>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/keymgmt/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Key Protect documentation</a> for the standard pricing model, steps on how to enable the new standard service plan, and appropriate actions needed for your Bluemix applications using the Key Protect service.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more about Key Protect, <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/key-protect/\" target=\"_blank\">visit the Key Protect section of the Bluemix Catalog</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you for using our IBM Key Protect encryption key management service.

height=\"120\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that Compose databases are now available from the Bluemix catalog? That&#8217;s Compose for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, RethinkDB and RabbitMQ, all production ready for your applications now. You can also get access to Compose&#8217;s beta offerings like etcd in a similarly simple fashion.</p>\n<p>Each database deployment from Compose is built with a multiple node, high availability configuration using the same technology Compose uses on other platforms. That means your databases are monitored, backed up and managed automatically.</p>\n<p>How do you get a Compose database on Bluemix? Just select, create and bind the Compose database of your choice to your application. You&#8217;ll find the <em>VCAP_SERVICES</em> data of your application is automatically updated with the information you need to connect to your new database.</p>\n<p>To make it even simpler, we&#8217;ve created sample apps for Node.js for all the current Compose databases, ready for you to download and use. Each app will get you up and running and connected to your Compose for Bluemix deployment.</p>\n<h2>Choosing a Compose Bluemix service</h2>\n<p>Each database has its own speciality. If you’re after a general purpose, widely used NoSQL JSON document database, start your database planning with <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-mongodb-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for MongoDB</a>. If you need a fast, in-memory cache or application shared state then <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-redis-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for Redis</a> should figure in your stack. If searching and scoring large amounts of free text is core to your application, then <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-elasticsearch-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for Elasticsearch</a> is your go-to-database. When you want a powerful structured relational database, <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-postgresql-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for PostgreSQL</a> will fulfill your needs with its rich SQL support. <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-rethinkdb-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for RethinkDB</a> can fill out your application stack with its real-time changefeeds for client applications. Messaging within your platform can be addressed by <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-rabbitmq-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for RabbitMQ</a> and its reliable broker technology. Finally, at least for now, <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-etcd-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for etcd</a> brings a reliable key/value store for configuration and other shared data.</p>\n<p>All of these databases are available from the Bluemix catalog and can run alongside each other so you can select the best combination for your applications.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>Let’s look at what’s involved in getting a MongoDB database up and running. The first port of call is the Bluemix Catalog, where you’ll find the Compose databases in the “Data &amp; Analytics” section. You can follow <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?search=Compose%20for\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a> to quickly search for the Compose databases. You should see this list:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-66587 aligncenter\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Bluemix-catalogue-compose-for-services-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Bluemix catalog search for Compose services\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Bluemix-catalogue-compose-for-services-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Bluemix-catalogue-compose-for-services-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Bluemix-catalogue-compose-for-services.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Remember to log in or sign up with Bluemix at this point so you can deploy a Compose database. Once you have done that, click Compose for MongoDB to see the catalog details for MongoDB:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-66589 aligncenter\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blumeix-Compose-for-MongoDB-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Compose for MongoDB\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blumeix-Compose-for-MongoDB-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blumeix-Compose-for-MongoDB-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blumeix-Compose-for-MongoDB.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can enter the service name and credentials name your application will use:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-66599 aligncenter\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mongodb-credentials-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"mongodb-credentials\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mongodb-credentials-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mongodb-credentials-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mongodb-credentials.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Compose databases autoscale, so at this point you&#8217;ll be provisioning a database with 1GB of storage and 102MB of RAM per database node in the cluster. As the cluster is replicated, that&#8217;s effectively 1GB of data storage. As the data grows, so will the storage available and, likewise, the RAM available to each database node.</p>\n<p>Clicking the <strong>Create</strong> button starts the process of provisioning this database service for you. When complete, it&#8217;ll appear like any other Bluemix service, in the dashboard. We haven&#8217;t yet bound the database to any application, but once we do, the credentials for the database would be passed to that application through <em>VCAP_ENV</em>.</p>\n<p>It’s then a matter for the application to retrieve them. The credentials for Compose for MongoDB are listed in the <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ComposeForMongoDB/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> for the service, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-mongodb-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for MongoDB</a> sample shows how to use the values in an application. To see our sample apps for the other databases, just search for <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=org%3AIBM-Bluemix+compose-\" target=\"_blank\">“compose-”</a> there to display all the current examples.</p>\n<h2>Connecting to the database</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-mongodb-helloworld-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">MongoDB example</a> shows how to locate a database service by type by searching for “Compose for MongoDB” in the service information and then using the credentials found in that location to create the connection to the server. The example breaks this process down step by step <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-mongodb-helloworld-nodejs/blob/master/server.js#L39\" target=\"_blank\">starting in server.js</a>, with detailed comments.</p>\n<p>For an even quicker start, clone and deploy the example and bind the MongoDB database instance previously created to the example. The steps to perform that are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-mongodb-helloworld-nodejs/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\">README</a> file for the example.</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-blogcta-_-RegisterforBluemix\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for Bluemix.

Instead, businesses face an explosion of customer feedback that fuels their ability to rapidly make decisions, quickly adjust direction and ultimately increase velocity.</p>\n<p>However, a pervasive challenge remains: unstructured content. The analysis of structured content – numbers, dates, organized groupings of words, which tell us WHAT is happening – has been largely conquered with traditional analytics systems; however, the analysis of unstructured content presents continuing challenges.  But it’s precisely unstructured content, like product reviews, social media and images, that tells us WHY things are happening.</p>\n<p>For example, I may know that my business is getting a tremendous amount of reviews for a newly launched product—all of that interest must be a great thing, right? Actually, it’s the text in those reviews that tells me<em> why</em> there’s a lot of interest. Maybe people love it … or maybe the product doesn’t meet customer’s expectations. What I need is an engine that will scour those reviews to reveal insights for my next decisions. Kind of like turning lemons into lemonade.</p>\n<h2>Turn Your Lemons into Lemonade with the Watson Discovery Service</h2>\n<p>Watson Discovery Service tackles this challenge head on. Now generally available, it lets developers rapidly build cognitive apps that extract value from structured and unstructured data. With the Watson Discovery Service, developers spend less time cleaning up and acquiring their data, and much more time analyzing and exploring it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easily ingest and normalize enormous amounts of unstructured proprietary and publicly available content—even if you have little or no systems engineering and machine learning skills</li>\n<li>Exploit third-party pre-enriched news data to enable highly targeted search and trend analysis</li>\n<li>Apply natural language processing and artificial intelligence capabilities to go far beyond simple keyword searches</li>\n<li>Perform multiple query types including boolean, filter and aggregation to discover patterns, trends and answers</li>\n<li>Easily add your Watson Discovery Service data to existing applications using REST APIs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watson Discovery Service brings together core Watson capabilities—like AlchemyLanguage and Document Conversion APIs, and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/supervised-machine-learning/us/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Watson Knowledge Studio</a> —into an integrated cognitive service that simply and efficiently ingests documents so you can identify critical correlations in vast amounts of unstructured content.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ks-cEG6KPs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Use Watson Discovery Service in any situation where you want to reveal value in unstructured and structured content, like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aid customer service representatives in delivering answers to complex customer questions</li>\n<li>Help researchers understand insights from vast numbers of research documents, industry journals and news content</li>\n<li>Extend Watson Conversation Service-based apps to find answers when modeled intents are insufficient to cover the breadth of possible questions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>Give the Watson Discovery Service a try for free for 30 days with our trial plan.

months ago, one of our most accessible and popular features is general tagging which allows users to understand the contents of images through various keyword tags.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re introducing an update to our algorithms that significantly enhances the performance of our general tagging feature. Users will not only see over three times more tags returned for each image on average, but also greater specificity in those tags due to a 150% increase in the active vocabulary of the system. On average, images are analyzed and returned with relevant tags in less than one second.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-68450\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/general-tagging-graphic-01-800x177.png\" alt=\"general-tagging-graphic-01\" width=\"800\" height=\"177\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/general-tagging-graphic-01-800x177.png 800w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/general-tagging-graphic-01-1024x226.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68453\" style=\"width: 735px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-68453\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-13-at-11.16.18-AM.png\" alt=\"The results on the left are generated from our previous algorithms, while the results on the right are generated from our updated algorithms.\" width=\"725\" height=\"564\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The results on the left are generated from our previous algorithms, while the results on the right are generated from our updated algorithms.</p></div>\n<h2>Visual Recognition for Big Data</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-68465\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Client-Logo-overview-slide_01.jpg\" alt=\"client-logo-overview-slide_01\" width=\"450\" height=\"117\" /></p>\n<p>Social media analytics company iTrend is already using Visual Recognition to power its data discovery platform.

width=\"274\" height=\"137\" />Introduced as an experimental service on Bluemix in February, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/openwhisk\">IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk</a> is now generally available. Both open source and serverless, OpenWhisk is a compute service that scalably executes code in runtime containers in response to configurable events and without the need to manage infrastructure.</p>\n<p>OpenWhisk’s simple and competitive <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">pricing model</a> provides a free tier for those who want to try it out.</p>\n<p>Through feeds, packages, and REST APIs, OpenWhisk provides powerful and easy access to the 150+ Bluemix services&#8211;including Cloudant, many Watson, data analytics, and DevOps pipeline services. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cK5i9MWHki8\">Hear</a> OpenWhisk&#8217;s senior research lead Stephen Fink discuss the platform&#8217;s versatility in integrating services.</p>\n<p>OpenWhisk recently integrated with MessageHub, an Bluemix-hosted Kafka service whose efficient and scalable message queue enables developers to build real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. This integration enables developers to fire triggers that launch OpenWhisk actions as soon as a new message is posted to a MessageHub topic.</p>\n<p>OpenWhisk includes additional support for Node v6, Python, Swift v3, and Java. That work on other runtimes has begun—for <a href=\"http://jamesthom.as/blog/2016/06/21/serverless-go-actions/\" target=\"_blank\">Go</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rainbyte/openwhisk-wrapper\" target=\"_blank\">Haskell</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/2016/07/26/openwhisk-actions-scala/\" target=\"_blank\">Scala</a>—reflects the momentum in the OpenWhisk open source community.</p>\n<p>Since OpenWhisk launched as an experimental service, companies across a range of industries have designed and built apps with it. SiteSpirit, a Netherlands-based software developer, has already moved their data-intensive MediaSpirit tool onto OpenWhisk. SiteSpirit combines OpenWhisk with cloud data services on Bluemix to help their customers implement advanced, flexibly-programmable, cloud-based data analytics that optimize infrastructure utilization through auto-scaling.</p>\n<h2>Other companies currently building with OpenWhisk include:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Santander Group</strong>, one of the world’s top banks by market capitalization with 12,500 branches in its 10 core markets throughout Europe and the Americas,  will use serverless and OpenWhisk in particular to help speed and optimize its digital banking.</li>\n<li><strong>LogitBot</strong>, a New York-based fintech company that uses data and AI to transform how investors research opportunities. OpenWhisk’s ability to decompose an app into distinct components has enabled LogitBot to more rapidly build and update their advanced data analytics platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Altoros, </strong>a U.S.-based but global software consulting firm, uses OpenWhisk to design serverless, trigger-based solutions for organizations across industries – including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation and logistics.</li>\n<li><strong>Nepente, </strong>a creative software design firm in Brazil, connect different parts of their existing apps and infrastructure through OpenWhisk, accelerating improvement of high-performing user experiences while reducing time to market.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OpenWhisk has been 100% open source from the beginning. Through a joint submission by IBM &amp; Adobe, OpenWhisk is now an Apache Incubator project. Most fundamentally, OpenWhisk currently is the only major serverless platform to offer an open, non-proprietary serverless engine that reduces the risk of vendor lock-in.</p>\n<p>Community efforts are integrating OpenWhisk with other open solutions and tools. A new <a href=\"https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-vscode\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio Code extension</a>, for example, improves the overall developer experience by enabling developers to create and work with actions without the need to leave their IDE.</p>\n<p>Keep up with all great things OpenWhisk on<a href=\"https://github.com/openwhisk/awesome-openwhisk\" target=\"_blank\"> GitHub</a></p>\n<p>Watch a <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/tv/build-a-cloud-native-app-with-openwhisk-event-registration/\" target=\"_blank\">coding demonstration</a> of OpenWhisk that talks through key concepts on the way to deploying a working app.</p>\n<p>We love to hear from users. In fact, based on developer feedback, we have released an experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-debugger\">real-time debugger</a> that allows users to debug actions locally, inspect parameter values, edit code, push changes in real-time.

information as it arrives from a wide variety of real-time data sources. A new version of the service has been released, upgrading the to the IBM Streams product version 4.2 as its basis. This version includes a number of exciting new features and enhancements, which can increase the power, performance and simplicity of your real-time analytic applications.</p>\n<p>Current users of Streaming Analytics do not need to take any action to continue to use the service. Your Streams instance has already been upgraded to the new version. Existing applications created using earlier Streams 4.x versions are still compatible with your upgraded Streams instance. However, if you want to exploit new features of Streams 4.2 in your applications, you need to upgrade to Streams 4.2 in your development environment. See the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/bluemix-streaming-analytics-development-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Streaming Analytics Development Guide</a> for instructions on how to set up a development environment.</p>\n<h2>Streaming Analytics Key Features and Enhancements</h2>\n<p>Streams 4.2 adds a number of new capabilities that can be exploited in the Bluemix environment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Develop Streams applications in Python</b> Python developers can now create Streams applications and operators purely in Python. The Streams Python Application API is similar to the Streams Java Application API released in Streams 4.1. It uses a functional style with operations on Streams and windows making it natural for Python developers while also mixing in powerful Stream processing concepts. Python has become a very popular language for data scientists with a large number of analytics available in modules like SciKits. These analytic modules can be used within Streams applications written in Python. You may also develop your Streams Python application interactively in a Jupyter Notebook, viewing Streams data and plotting visualizations in the Notebook.</li>\n<li><b>Let Streams optimize performance for you</b> Streams 4.2 will intelligently perform an optimization on your Streams application that had to be done manually in the past. Fusion is the assignment of Streams operators to processes. Fusion has always been a key element in performance tuning of Streams applications. Now in Streams 4.2, fusion can be performed automatically at run-time, based on the resources available to host the application. You still have the ability to manually control fusion in any or all parts of your app, but for the parts you do not wish to control, an intelligent fusion configuration will be generated by default.</li>\n<li><b>Compile business rules directly into your Streams application</b> Streams 4.2 supports a deeper integration with IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM). ODM provides a rules language for easily describing business rules and a rich set of tooling to create and manage the rules. Streams 4.2 introduces a rules compiler that generates Streams operators, which are embedded directly into your Streams applications to achieve execution optimized for high performance and low latency. Compiled rules can also be dynamically updated in Streams applications while they are running. In addition, your Streams 4.2 development environment, Streams Studio, now offers a business rules project with the ODM rules designer embedded within it. Once you&#8217;ve built your Streams application with compiled rules in your development environment, you can deploy the resulting application bundle to run in your Streaming Analytics instance in Bluemix.</li>\n<li><b>Extend your analytic applications to the edge</b> Streams applications are often used to process data from sensors and other edge devices. In February, IBM announced an open source project to build a community for accelerating analytics at the edge that is now undergoing incubation at the Apache Software foundation as Apache Edgent. Streams V4.2 includes an integration with Apache Edgent and Watson IoT Platform to provide a hierarchy of edge to center analytics across devices. The ability to run analytics on edge devices in conjunction with a Streams application running in the cloud enables solutions to react locally to events, and to immediately send only relevant data to the central analytic systems, instead of relying on periodic transfers of all device data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to Streams 4.2 highlights listed above, there are many more enhancements in Streams 4.2 in areas including performance, toolkits, Streams console, security, and application deployment.

working on in-place upgrades of fabric.  In the interim, we will periodically upgrade your fabric version.   This requires you to do a quick re-provision in order to get your network running again.</p>\n<p>As of <strong>December 30, 2016</strong>, we will be deleting all service version 0.4.X instances of the IBM Blockchain “Starter Developer Plan” Beta service on Bluemix. In addition, all networks — regardless of version — with over 15 days of inactivity will be deleted.</p>\n<p>On November 10, 2016, we performed an upgrade to use the latest Hyperledger Fabric v0.6.1. In order to best support you and to continue improving this Beta service, we will be deleting all networks using a previous version. It is crucial for users to create a new service instance to make use of these updates.</p>\n<p>Please note that we are not retiring a service or plan, but rather deleting all service instances running versions prior to v1.0.X. You can verify which version of the IBM Blockchain Starter Developer Plan beta service you are using, by going to the &#8220;Service Status&#8221; Dashboard on the IBM Blockchain service on Bluemix. Although your network will be deleted, you can create a new one at any time. High Security Business Network plan customers are not impacted; these instructions are <em>only for the Starter Developer plan users.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Previous versions (To be deleted): </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service version 0.4.X using Hyperledger Fabric 0.5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Current versions (You can create a new instance at any time):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service version 1.0.X using Hyperledger Fabric 0.6.1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will also need to update your chaincode for newly created service instances using the instructions in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-blogcta-_-RegisterforBluemix\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for Bluemix.

href=\"https://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/iot-solutions/iot-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\">IoT for Insurance</a> service became generally available (GA) on November 18, 2016.</p>\n<p>Related news: We will be retiring the IoT for Insurance beta instances as a result of this GA.</p>\n<h2>What to know about the beta to GA transition</h2>\n<h3>The End of Beta Date: January 5, 2017</h3>\n<p>As of January 5, 2017, new IoT for Insurance beta instances cannot be provisioned. However, existing instances will continue to be supported.</p>\n<h3>The End of Beta Support Date: February 4, 2017</h3>\n<p>For a period of 30 days after the <strong>End of Beta Date</strong> (through February 4, 2017), all existing instances will continue to be available on the Services dashboard in the Bluemix console. All existing instances will also continue to be supported by IoT for Insurance. Any instance still provisioned as of the <strong>End of Beta Support Date</strong> will be deleted. Please delete your IoT for Insurance Beta service instances before the <strong>End of Beta Support Date</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Features of the GA version of IoT for Insurance</h2>\n<h3>Insurance dashboard</h3>\n<p>The Insurance Dashboard gives insurance company users, such as agents, a complete view of what is happening with their customers&#8217; insured assets. They can see the shields and events at a country, state, or account levels. The sample insurance dashboard is loaded with simulated data to show you an example of the kind of information that you can collect and analyze.</p>\n<h3>Sample mobile app</h3>\n<p>The sample mobile app is where insurance policy holders such, as homeowners, view and respond to the information that IoT for Insurance sends from the sensors in their homes. Using a mobile device, homeowners authorize the service to connect to the sensor provider&#8217;s cloud to send and receive data. For example, a homeowner might receive a notification in the mobile starter app when the sensor detects a water leak.</p>\n<h3>REST and real-time APIs</h3>\n<p>The REST APIs are used by the mobile starter app, the insurance dashboard, the shield engine, and the hazard controller. They let users understand the associations that exist between devices, shields, and actions. By using the APIs, programmers can create new users, generate event data, create and register new shields, and fetch event data. The API that you access from the service console is customized for your instance of IoT for Insurance.</p>\n<p>On the API page, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View all available API calls and associated documentation</li>\n<li>Try individual API calls. Select an API call to display all information, then click <strong>Try it out!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>API examples are available to help you get started with common scenarios. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/iot4i-api-examples-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\">IoT for Insurance API examples</a>.</p>\n<h3>Shield engine</h3>\n<p>Based on the information stored in an event, the shield engine determines if a hazard such as a water leak occurred. If a hazard is identified, it is passed to the action engine.</p>\n<h3>Action engine</h3>\n<p>The action engine determines the actions to take based on the information that is specified in the shield. You can create new shields in JavaScript by using the IoT for Insurance API.</p>\n<h3>Shields</h3>\n<p>A shield is a specific protection that a customer acquires from the insurance provider. For example, a homeowner purchases insurance on their home to shield it against fire, water damage, burglaries, and other hazards. The IoT for Insurance solution provides a built-in shield against water. Customers are alerted and can respond when an event that involves water threatens their home.</p>\n<p>Using the REST API, developers can add more shields. Shields run in the IoT for Insurance analytics engine. The analytics engine identifies the type of hazard (for example, water is detected), the user account of the sensor that sent the hazard, and the shields that are associated with the account. Action can be taken based on that information.</p>\n<h3>Extensibility toolkit</h3>\n<p>With IBM IoT for Insurance, a toolkit is provided to permit the addition of additional devices for capturing data and for additional shields for utilization of the captured data. Users can extend the capabilities of IoT for Insurance with the extensibility toolkit, allowing a full set of usage scenarios for policy holders to be provided.</p>\n<p>Please see this <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/09/iot-insurance-digitizing-policyholders/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> for more information on IoT for Insurance.

While opening one new data center is good—<em>ahem</em>, big—enough, we didn&#8217;t feel like going home just yet. We&#8217;re also launching four new data centers in the UK starting next month, joining our happy family of 16 data centers across Europe. These latest additions across the pond expand our cloud data center footprint from two to six in the UK and grow our network to over 50 data centers around the globe.</p>\n<p>We told you we go big.</p>\n<h2>Why more Data Centers in the UK?</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering, &#8220;How&#8217;d they choose the UK? Why not [insert country of choice here]?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Let us explain.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, cloud adoption in the UK has <a href=\"https://www.cloudindustryforum.org/content/uk-cloud-adoption-rate-climbs-84-finds-new-research-cloud-industry-forum?cm_mc_uid=33000557428314793144540&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=1479853545\" target=\"_blank\">increased a whopping 84 percent</a>. (Whoa, right?) If that isn&#8217;t enough, 70 percent of cloud-adopting UK businesses and organizations expect their usage to increase in the coming 12 months. In short: the UK needed us and we came to the rescue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are already among the most digitally connected countries in the world, with a globally successful digital economy worth more than £118billion a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business,” Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture, <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/51091.wss\" target=\"_blank\">told IBM</a>. &#8220;[This] is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business.

Your teams can now use end-to-end solutions to deliver innovative new services to users.</p>\n<p>Continuous Delivery enables speed with control, at enterprise scale. The service includes several components that you’re likely familiar with, including Delivery Pipeline, the Eclipse Orion Web IDE, and the Open Toolchain fabric, which integrates your favorite tools into bundles to deliver immediate value to your teams. Recently added is IBM Cloud DevOps Insights, an experimental tool that uses analytics to advise on the likelihood of deployment success.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bluemix.net/devops\" target=\"_blank\">Start using Continuous Delivery today</a>.</p>\n<p>Our team has been on the Continuous Delivery journey all year. In May 2016, we delivered Bluemix toolchains as an <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/2016/06/16/open-toolchain-with-ibm-bluemix-devops-services/\" target=\"_blank\">experiment</a>. Toolchains graduated to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/09/toolchains-beta-on-bluemix/\" target=\"_blank\">beta</a> in September 2016. Now, with <a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/11/simplify-devops-transformation-bluemix-continuous-delivery/\" target=\"_blank\">Continuous Delivery</a>, toolchains are a live service.</p>\n<p>As we’ve been forging our journey with clients to cloud-native microservice architectures, we’ve been focused on critical problems within the enterprise — pre-integrated solutions of best of breed tools to enable you to deliver at cloud-speed, with deep insights and reporting about the health of your overall delivery process.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the scenarios that you can adopt and build on today. When you get started with Continuous Delivery, you’ll find two optimized paths.</p>\n<h2>Path 1: Quickly deploy code from GitHub to Bluemix</h2>\n<p>Have code that you must deploy? You can integrate all of your repositories at GitHub.com and deploy Cloud Foundry or container applications with a simple yet extensible pipeline.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://bluemix.net/devops/pipelines/dashboard/create\" target=\"_blank\">Get Started with a Delivery Pipeline</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you set up a pipeline, you can clone, fork, or create a Git repository. The pipeline is automatically defined to build and deploy the corresponding application to Bluemix. With a few clicks, you’ll have a simple toolchain that is complete with GitHub Issues, a source-control repository, and a delivery pipeline.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-62986\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-62986 size-full\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline1.png\" alt=\"Bluemix Devops build deploy pipeline\" width=\"1424\" height=\"762\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline1-800x428.png 800w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline1-1024x548.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline1.png 1424w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Each time you push code changes to your GitHub repository, another build and deployment are triggered. You can customize the pipeline with more jobs or stages. You can also add more tools to your toolchain by selecting them from the tool integrations catalog.</p>\n<h2>Path 2: Set up an end-to-end solution of industry-leading tools</h2>\n<p>If your team already delivers to the cloud, your delivery process probably involves more than just a pipeline — you need an integrated solution to both deliver and manage your apps. With toolchains, you get pre-integrated templates of tool sets that leverage cloud-based solutions, such as Slack, PagerDuty, and Sauce Labs.</p>\n<p>Take a closer look at one of the templates: the Microservices toolchain, which demonstrates an online store sample application that consists of three microservices. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, blue-green deployment, functional testing, issue tracking, online editing, and alert notification. You can find more templates at <a href=\"http://bluemix.net/devops/create\" target=\"_blank\">bluemix.net/devops/create</a>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fopen-toolchain%2Ftoolchain-demo\" target=\"_blank\">Get Started with a Microservices complete toolchain</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/microserves-toolchain.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-62620\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-62620 size-full\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/microserves-toolchain.png\" alt=\"Github microservice toolchain\" width=\"763\" height=\"491\" /></a></p>\n<p>As part of configuration, you can clone the base example into three GitHub repositories of your choice. Each repository is associated with a distinct pipeline to achieve full independence. To make rapid iterations on your application, you can use the built-in web integrated development environment (IDE), which is based on Eclipse Orion. In addition, you have access to early support for DevOps Insights, which provides test report aggregation and automated policy decisions that are based on cover coverage and automated test results. A few of the preselected third-party tool integrations require credentials. If you don’t have them, you can ignore them and reconfigure or remove them later.

For example, in catalog-api, edit the <code>/routes/item.js</code> file and uncomment the block comment in the <code>#loadTest()</code> function. Then, do not add more test cases so that the code/test ratio will fall behind the configured threshold. Deliver your change by using the Web IDE, and watch the catalog-api pipeline automatically build, but fail to deploy because of a code coverage regression.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline3.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-63007\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-63007 size-full\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline3.png\" alt=\"Bluemix Devops API Tool Chain Demo\" width=\"1723\" height=\"687\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline3-800x319.png 800w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline3-1024x408.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-pipeline3.png 1723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1723px) 100vw, 1723px\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can view the associated decision report that explains the code coverage regression by exploring the pipeline’s job log.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-decisionreport.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-63010\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-63010 size-full\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-decisionreport.png\" alt=\"Devops Insights Decision Report\" width=\"1716\" height=\"928\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-decisionreport-800x433.png 800w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-decisionreport-1024x554.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b-decisionreport.png 1716w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1716px) 100vw, 1716px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Useful tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Your feedback is welcome.

The DEA architecture served the Cloud Foundry Foundation and Bluemix well, but continued innovation has delivered a broad range of improvements and enhanced the overall operation of the Cloud Foundry platform. As the world&#8217;s largest Cloud Foundry implementation, Bluemix benefits substantially from these enhancements.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited about the role IBM plays in the Cloud Foundry Foundation, the contributions we&#8217;ve made to key Cloud Foundry projects like Diego, and our support of Open Technology software like Cloud Foundry. This is a great step for Cloud Foundry and a strong move forward in our Bluemix cloud platform offering.</p>\n<h2>Get to know Diego</h2>\n<p>Diego is a new Cloud Foundry architecture with a set of capabilities that enhances the application development experience and features new capabilities for hosting and constructing cloud platforms, like IBM Bluemix. Diego is the path forward for future upgrades, expansions, and features.</p>\n<p>The new architecture brings a number of changes to the Cloud Foundry platform that improve the overall operation and performance: an re-write from Ruby to Go allowed improvements to the overall design, a switch from a &#8220;DEA node&#8221; to a &#8220;Diego cell,&#8221; a new container management system called Garden that allows diverse operating system containers beyond Linux, the differentiation between single-run and long-running jobs, and an SSH package that allows direct login to the application container. These and many other exciting changes are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/diego/dea-vs-diego.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Although new features have been (and will be) added to the application development capabilities of Cloud Foundry, existing applications don&#8217;t need many—if any—changes. But they do need to be deployed to the new Diego architecture on Bluemix.</p>\n<p>The initial Bluemix Public generally available deployment of Diego will take place in January 2017. Existing workloads will run undisturbed on the existing infrastructure, with all new deployments occurring on the Diego infrastructure. A comprehensive migration effort is slated for early 2017 to make sure all current customer applications are moved to Diego.</p>\n<h2>Migrate your application to Diego</h2>\n<p>For a Bluemix Cloud Foundry application developer to proactively re-deploy applications, the steps are simple. Right now you can optionally deploy to the beta Diego infrastructure by using the command line to do a deploy with a special flag. After Diego becomes the generally available default architecture, all deployments default to Diego and the flag is no longer needed. In early 2017, IBM Bluemix will begin re-deploying un-migrated applications. For more details, see the steps in <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#appdeploy\" target=\"_blank\">Application Deployment</a>.</p>\n<h2>Learn more about Diego</h2>\n<p>Explore the new Diego infrastructure and dig into the full documentation for the Bluemix Cloud Foundry application operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html\" target=\"_blank\">A dive into Diego&#8217;s architecture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/diego/dea-vs-diego.html\" target=\"_blank\">The differences between DEA and Diego architectures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/mngapps.html#manageapps\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Bluemix Cloud Foundry Managing Apps documentation:</a> Everything you need to know about managing Cloud Foundry apps in Bluemix</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Bluemix-_-RegisterforBluemix\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for Bluemix.

IBM Middleware products. It helps IT administrators track product instances and report usage metrics, and opens up possibilities to integrate with other hybrid cloud services.</p>\n<p>With the Hybrid Connect service, IT administrators can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Register and track</strong> on-premises product instances and usage all-in-one dashboard</li>\n<li><strong>Query</strong> by platform, version or other metrics</li>\n<li><strong>Analyze</strong> various product usage metrics over time</li>\n<li><strong>Discover</strong> under-used instances to help optimize environments</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Many enterprises struggle with tracking product entitlements and usage. They do not know how the products are being used across the enterprise or know their capacity on a day-to-day basis. Some organizations have created elaborate databases or employed specific people or services groups to build inventory reports and track the Middleware they are using.</p>\n<p>Using Hybrid Connect, organizations have the opportunity to extend their existing on-premises products and achieve the benefits of hybrid cloud environments. As an example, IT administrators can register all of their products in a single dashboard, which simplifies some management tasks. Or, a capacity planner can optimize and adjust their environment based on product usage metrics.</p>\n<p>You can use this service immediately with the latest Middleware interim fix at no additional cost to the organization.</p>\n<p>The Hybrid Connect service is available in the Integrate category for experimental services in Bluemix:</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/hybrid-connect/?cm_sp=bluemixblog-_-HybridConnect-_-annc\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Hybrid Connect</a></p>\n<p><i style=\"font-size: 80%;\">* see <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/W04c8ca6d7a05_453c_8e2d_b784cde378be\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Cloud Hybrid Connect Customer Program wiki</a> for supported versions detail.</i></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/11/hybrid-connect-available-experimental-service/","date":"2016-11-17T09:00:03","modified":"2016-12-07T16:21:15","format":"standard","slug":"hybrid-connect-available-experimental-service","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/?p=62026","excerpt":"<p>Hybrid Connect enhances the way that you can register and track IBM Middleware products.

officially announce that the IBM Bluemix <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/\">OpenWhisk</a> compute service is an open Beta offering. The experimental offering period period began in February, 2016 and the Beta period began in September.</p>\n<p>OpenWhisk is an open source, serverless programming platform for developers to create &#8220;<a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn\">actions</a>&#8220;- small pieces of code in their favorite supported language (currently Java, Node.js, Swift, Python) that run in relevant runtimes within Docker containers launched for the short time needed.</p>\n<p>OpenWhisk uses containers&#8211;which accelerate instantiation, deployment, and management&#8211;to support a trigger-based automation of  actions (individually or as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuUv4_6Tk68\">sequence</a>) that can powerfully drive the real-time workflow of cloud-native mobile applications. An open API enables creating the <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/openwhisk/openwhisk_packages.html\">packages</a> (event producers and consumers) on which the application automation is built.</p>\n<p>Users of OpenWhisk pay only for compute services used during the execution of actions. Currently, as in the experimental offering, the Beta is free to use in Bluemix, but with increases in computing limits that support bigger workloads.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s new in Beta as compared to the initial experimental launch? Highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Programming language support for Node 6, Python, and Swift 3</li>\n<li>An improved model for using your own Docker containers as OpenWhisk actions</li>\n<li>A browser-based interface for creating, editing, monitoring, and configuring actions, sequence, and integrations</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/cli\">CLI</a> that is easier to install</li>\n<li>Event packages/providers for Cloudant, Github, IBM Push Notifications</li>\n<li>Ready-made actions for Bluemix services: Cloudant, Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix, IBM Watson, Slack, IBM Push Notifications, and web sockets</li>\n<li>Downloadable SDK and sample iOS applications</li>\n<li>A growing repository of open source applications in Github, including <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/03/webinar-automatically-analyzing-videos-with-watson-and-openwhisk/\">Dark Vision</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/04/webinar-drones-take-off-with-ibm-bluemix-openwhisk/\">Skylink</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The OpenWhisk source code base is open source.

class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/node-js-icon.png\" alt=\"\" /> By the end of the year we will pass several significant dates on the <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/LTS\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js long-term support (LTS) schedule</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>v6 was promoted to LTS status on October 18, 2016</li>\n<li>v0.10 will reach end of life on October 31, 2016</li>\n<li>v0.12 will reach end of life on December 31, 2016.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What does this mean for Bluemix?</h2>\n<p>The default version for the SDK for Node.js, which is used when you do not specify a version in your app’s <code>package.json</code> file, will change from v4 to v6. <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v6.0.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js v6 delivers many improvements</a> over older releases over older releases, including better performance.</p>\n<p>Additionally the buildpack will no longer bundle v0.10 and 0.12 of the SDK for Node.js binaries. While we recommend that you no longer use v0.10 or v0.12 after they reach end of life, if you request v0.10 or v.012 in your app’s <code>package.json</code> file, it will instead download the community version from <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/dist/\" target=\"_blank\">nodejs.org/dist/</a> during staging. In addition to issues related to using a version at end of life (no security updates, etc.), the additional download will slow down staging and adds a dependency on an external site affecting reliability.</p>\n<h2>What you should do</h2>\n<p>If your app is still using v0.10 or v0.12, start thinking about migrating it to v4 or (preferably) v6. Specifying a Node.js major version in your app&#8217;s <code>package.json</code> file is also a great way to eliminate any surprises as the buildpack evolves. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">{\r\n        ...\r\n        &quot;engines&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;node&quot;: &quot;4.x&quot;\r\n        }\r\n}</pre>\n<p>Specifying the major version of <code>4</code> keeps your app on the v4 release where there will be minimal breaking changes, but allows it to pick up new minor versions every time the app is restaged.</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Bluemix-_-RegisterforBluemix\">Sign up for Bluemix.

We now require that our IBMers provide you with information that is split into three distinct categories: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview</li>\n<li>Deployment impact</li>\n<li>Changes for our customers </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every new deployment will include the following information as applicable:</p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/User_Comm1.png\"  /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When is the window in which the deployment needs to be scheduled or when has it been scheduled?</li>\n<li>Which service or component is affected?</li>\n<li>What are the overall changes?</li>\n<li>Does this deployment have dependencies on other deployments? If so, what is the dependency?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deployment impact</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/User_Comm2.jpg\"  /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long will the deployment process take?</li>\n<li>Is the change disruptive to the environment? If so, what type of disruption will occur? What is the disruption? How long will the disruption take?</li>\n<li>Do you need to complete any post-deployment actions? If so, what actions are needed?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes for our customers</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/User_Comm3.png\"  /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the benefits of the change?</li>\n<li>Will the changes affect your end users?</li>\n<li>What types of customer roles will be affected by the change? For example, administrators, deployers, and so on.</li>\n<li>What parts of the Bluemix experience will be affected after the deployment? For example, will you see changes to the user interface, the Bluemix catalog, or new/existing service instances?</li>\n<li>What type of user impact will be involved? Will you have access to new functionality, experience greater response time, or see an increase in reliability?</li>\n<li>Where can you find more information about the change? (optional)</li>\n<li>Was this change initiated by a Support ticket? If so, what is the ticket number? (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: These communication changes do not apply to changes that are already “in flight” in our internal approval process. Thus, you might see a mixture of the old template and the new template for a short period of time. </p>\n<p>Do you have other ideas to improve the Bluemix platform?

Insights for Twitter service on IBM Bluemix currently uses Gnip 1.0.

Twitter will stop supporting Gnip 1.0 as of December 1, 2016.</p>\n<h3><strong>How it may affect you</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://support.gnip.com/gnip2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Gnip 2.0</a> brings new data types and more powerful rules and queries, among other benefits. However, please note that this has significant implications for you if you are using Powertrack.  Some examples of changes are: deprecation of some operators of the Powertrack rules and revisions to the way others are interpreted by Gnip 2.0. Such changes may result in a Powertrack 1.0 rule to receive incorrect results or an error message. The Powertrack 2.0 details can be found <a href=\"http://support.gnip.com/apis/powertrack2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>What you need to do</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are using Powertrack, you must migrate your Powertrack rules to comply with Gnip 2.0 when the Insights for Twitter service moves over to Gnip 2.0.</p>\n<h2>Where to get help</h2>\n<p>All that you need to know regarding Gnip 2.0 is available <a href=\"http://support.gnip.com/gnip2.0\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. This includes the changes, the impact of the changes, guides for migrating from 1.0 to 2.0, examples and documentation.</p>\n<p>If you need help during your migration of Powertrack rules, our engineers will be glad to help. You can post a question on <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/answers/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">dW Answers</a> or <a href=\"https://support.ng.bluemix.net/supportticket/?app=technicalsupport&amp;index=8\" target=\"_blank\">open a support ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>In summary, Insights for Twitter will start using Gnip 2.0 instead of Gnip 1.0 starting November 28th.

the Operations Analytics service is now available as an experimental service on Bluemix.</p>\n<p>Operations Analytics uses powerful, self-learning analytics to analyze log and metric data from your WebSphere services in real time. In its analysis, the service identifies any anomalies in the data that could indicate a potential outage or service degradation.

of hosted Blockchain offering which we called the High Security Business Network (HSBN).  Like the Starter Developer plan in the Blockchain service, it utilizes the Hyperledger fabric as its runtime fabric.  It is focused on performance, data privacy and security. HSBN is intended for customers wanting to move beyond basic blockchain exploration towards corporate PoCs, first projects, pilots and production.</p>\n<p>The response from the blockchain community has been fantastic and we were pleasantly surprised (and a little dismayed) to quickly subscribe our initial capacity.  Even better, we hosted a range of users from large enterprise to startups to research groups&#8211;all attracted to the attributes of the environment.  For example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn7bILEJ-nY\" target=\"_blank\">check out</a> why Everledger,  a startup revolutionizing the diamond industry by using blockchain technology to track diamonds from mine to store, chose HSBN as their blockchain platform.</p>\n<h2>What makes the High Security Business Network a different blockchain service</h2>\n<p>HSBN is a great fit for Enterprise use especially in regulated industries or for customers with sensitive data.  It compliments the Starter plan which provides tools and an atomically sized blockchain network for Developers.  Those same tools and dashboard are available for HSBN.  The HSBN plan runs the same configuration in a dedicated compute environment.  In addition to high performance compute, it provides a high speed network and local HSMs for keys with cryptographic acceleration.  But what really makes the HSBN service different is its focus on security.</p>\n<h3><strong>Blockchain on Bluemix Plans</strong></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/blockchain-on-bluemix-plans_edited.png\" alt=\"Blockchain on Bluemix Plans\" /></p>\n<p>While the security capabilities really deserve a post in their own right, I&#8217;ll list a few here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tamper resistance HSM with key safety up to FIPS 140-2 Level 4.</li>\n<li>Protection against privileged user credential misuse (&#8220;Snowden Attacks&#8221;) and no SSH access for anyone.</li>\n<li>A system with Evaluation Assurance Level up to 5+.</li>\n<li>Secure Service Container with malware protection.</li>\n<li>Data privacy in flight and at rest on isolated storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HSBN is Generally Available through engagement with IBM</h2>\n<p>Till today, we have been operating the service plan as a closed beta.  It is now <a href=\"https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/rep_ca/1/897/ENUS216-491/ENUS216-491.PDF\">generally available</a>.  Somewhat unusual for Bluemix services, we are not currently making HSBN available for self-service use.  To get access, you must first contact us and have a free discussion with our Blockchain Garage team.  You can do this directly within the <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/\">Blockchain service page in the Bluemix catalog</a>.  Just select the HSBN plan and click on the &#8220;Request&#8221; button to fill in your contact information.</p>\n<p>We are here to help you wherever you are on your blockchain journey&#8211;kicking the tires, building a proof of concept, rolling out a first-of-kind pilot or starting the next big disruption in stealth mode.</p>\n<p>—IBM Blockchain Team</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Bluemix-_-RegisterforBluemix\">Sign up for Bluemix.

Now, all of our clients are leveraging Mitaka’s new capabilities, and the upgrade processes were non-disruptive events for our clients.</p>\n<p>How were we so confident that we’d deliver on this promise? Our private cloud service was acquired by IBM for our operational management expertise. We upgrade OpenStack for our day job, in addition to carrying out countless new deployments and expansions for our clients. As a managed private cloud service, this is business as usual for our operations staff.</p>\n<p>As a true DevOps team, our operational excellence isn’t the only accomplishment worth celebrating. We’ve also developed and delivered new capabilities and performance enhancements for our IBM Bluemix Private Cloud. Here’s a sneak peek into some of the latest features that our IBM Bluemix Private Cloud and Bluemix Private Cloud Local customers can expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-cloud management, simplified:</strong> Recently, we introduced an OpenStack <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/07/keystone-to-keystone-federated-identity-on-blue-box-cloud/\">Keystone to Keystone Federated Identity service</a>. This allows clients to securely access and manage multiple clouds from one integrated view, using a single credential. We’ve further enhanced this service with Federated Keystone-Idp. You can now leverage existing identity management and authentication infrastructure to manage your IBM Bluemix Private Cloud identity and authorization with ease. Our Federated Keystone capability uses industry-standard federation protocols, including OpenID-Connect and the newly-introduced SAML2.0 protocol. Using SAML2.0, you can log in with your enterprise credentials, without having to send your password to your IBM Bluemix Private Clouds&#8211; or replicate your credentials to multiple clouds. In essence, managing multiple clouds has never been more simple, flexible, or secure.</li>\n<li><strong>High-performance storage, tailored to your needs:</strong> You may have heard that we offer a variety of <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/08/blue-box-storage-models-explained/\">OpenStack storage models</a> that help our clients select the options that best suit their use cases. Our options have expanded even further: Customers with diverse storage requirements can now leverage both SSD and cost-effective Hybrid storage pools together in the same cloud. You can also match your workloads’ IOPS requirements to the optimal block storage pool, for greater customization and control. We&#8217;ve also upgraded our Ceph block storage option to the Jewel release, which delivers improved, leading-edge performance (IOPS) for block storage. This upgrade also enables customers to unlock improved stability to run their high-performance workloads.</li>\n<li><strong>Lenovo hardware:</strong> Many IBM clients choose Lenovo hardware to power their data center environments, and with good reason. To enable client success across the enterprise, our joint alliance delivers innovative solutions, top-notch quality, and exceptional support. That’s why we’re excited to announce that, in addition to our Cisco UCS platform and support for IBM Bluemix Local System, an all-new, Lenovo-curated bill of materials has been added to our portfolio. You can now enjoy more hardware options for deploying your business-critical workloads in your IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Local environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Enterprise-grade security for an enterprise-grade private cloud: </strong> Data sovereignty plays a critical factor in maintaining an effective private cloud environment. IBM Bluemix Private Cloud is committed toward providing clients with a security-rich, OpenStack-private cloud, to help you achieve your security control objectives. In addition to being HIPAA-ready, IBM Bluemix Private Cloud is now ISO 27001 and ISO 27018 compliant. We’ve also successfully completed SOC II and SOC III external audits, to further safeguard your information.

With this announcement, clients in China can purchase an annual subscription of the <a href=\"https://console.chinabluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">China Bluemix</a> instance operated by 21Vianet. Of course they also have the flexibility to choose alternative deployment models, namely Bluemix Dedicated or Bluemix Local.</p>\n<p>October 19th is also the last day of the 2016 Vaude Tibet Challenge—a 10 day, 2000 kilometer extreme bicycle race from Sichuan province to Tibet along China&#8217;s Route 318 national highway. The average elevation of this section of the highway is more than 4000 meters.

You&#8217;ll also have a single payment method and pay for those services from a consolidated invoice. These enhancements we are delivering today will help customers who told us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I want to manage all my Bluemix and SoftLayer assets from a single console”</li>\n<li>“I want to use a single ID to log into that single console”</li>\n<li>“I want to be billed with a single invoice”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To illustrate, let&#8217;s walk through a scenario that shows how combining infrastructure, services, and application run-times can result in something truly remarkable.</p>\n<h2>Example of unified cloud platform experience</h2>\n<p>In this scenario, you work at an insurance company that wants to use drones to take photos of storm damage, uploads the photos to IBM Cloud where those photos are studied for damage, then creates a 3D model of the damaged regions.  While you can fly the drones and take photos, you really need a complete solution to go from the field to a quality claim.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single starting point: www.ibm.com/bluemix</strong></h3>\n<p>To start, go to <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/bluemix\" target=\"_blank\">www.ibm.com/bluemix</a>, where you will discover that Bluemix is more than a PaaS solution. Bluemix is a complete cloud platform that includes app runtimes, services, and infrastructure. In other words, the Bluemix moniker now encompasses Bluemix services <em>and</em> SoftLayer offerings like bare metal servers. Here you will find details and be able to order bare metal servers, virtual servers, object storage, and other infrastructure offerings you previously ordered from SoftLayer&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>Certainly changes like this may prompt many questions, so rest assured we are taking things slowly to make sure you are guided through each step and can continue build awesome solutions with Bluemix. For example, <a href=\"http://softlayer.com\" target=\"_blank\">softlayer.com</a> won’t go away yet, so you&#8217;re free to explore the changes as time allows.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single ID</strong></h3>\n<p>To get the drone solution running, you log into <a href=\"http://www.bluemix.net\" target=\"_blank\">bluemix.net</a> with your IBM ID. No longer will you have to manage separate SoftLayer and Bluemix IDs. Now it’s a single IBM ID.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gregh-bluemix-login.png\" alt=\"login\" /></p>\n<p>Note: If you are an existing SoftLayer customer, you can choose to upgrade your account to access the full experience, or stay with your SoftLayer ID for now, but without the advantage of the single ID, invoice, or updated experience you’ll learn about below.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single console</strong></h3>\n<p>Once logged in, instantly you’ll see some changes. The new light-colored theme, new banner, new navigation, and an updated catalog. When you select the catalog, you’ll see three global categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Infrastructure:</i> Includes all infrastructure integrated from SoftLayer: Bare Metal Servers, Virtual Servers, VMware, Storage, and Security.</li>\n<li><i>Apps:</i> Includes the application run-times you are familiar with in Bluemix today: Boilerplates, Cloud Foundry, Containers, OpenWhisk, and Mobile</li>\n<li><i>Services:</i> Includes all the services you know and love in Bluemix today: Watson, Data &amp; Analytics, IoT, DevOps, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 80%;\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gregh-bluemix-Unified-Catalog.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Think about it. Now in Bluemix you can create a drone insurance solution by ordering everything from bare metal servers to Watson to a Node.js runtime—all from one UI—and then manage each asset:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Watson Visual Recognition</em> – First you wanted to try out Watson. Sure enough, even with the sample apps you learn that Watson can ‘see’ images and be trained to see very specific details like storm damage.</li>\n<li><em>Cloud Foundry runtime</em> – Perfect for you to just add code to create an intuitive web UI for the field agent to upload photos and manage claims</li>\n<li><em>Cloudant Database</em> – Your CF app can index and tag all the photos that are uploaded</li>\n<li><em>Object Storag</em>e – Your CF app can then call the Swift API supported by Cloud Object Storage to store thousands of photos in your region of choice to honor government regulations and privacy laws</li>\n<li><em>Bare Metal</em> – Finally you can code an application to create a 3D rendering of damaged areas using the speed of bare metal servers where you can customize how many processors, how much memory, and even customize with high-speed GPUs for lightning fast processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that you have activated all your resources and added your apps, you can use the new navigation bar on the left to focus in on what you want to manage. In the dropdown you’ll see the same Applications, Services, and Infrastructure categories that you saw in the catalog as well as detailed navigation selections to choose from. To navigate, simply select the menu icon on the far left (three lined graphic), and you’ll see the navigation fly out.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gregh-bluemix-services-navigation.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>For example, if you want to view the bare metal servers you are using, select Infrastructure, then “Devices”. If you are familiar with how SoftLayer infrastructure is organized, this will be very similar for you. Then, if you want to jump back to see your applications and services, select “Applications &gt; Dashboard” and you’ll see all apps and services in one view.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 90%; border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gregh_Bluemix-Infrastructure.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In this case you can see your Cloud Foundry, Watson, and Cloudant resources:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 80%;\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gregh-Bluemix-Dashboard-services.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>During your development of your solution, you may find that the DevOps services in Bluemix can help greatly to keep your solution automatically scaled, monitored, and automated.</p>\n<p>Eventually, there may be times you need to open a ticket to get help from IBM. New today also is an integrated support UI. Regardless of the category you are in you can open tickets and track from that category. Further, we’ve enhanced our tiered support system so if you are paying for support, it now covers all of Bluemix—from Apps, Services, and Infrastructure.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Invoice</strong></h3>\n<p>With your drone solution now running, at the end of the month you will receive a single invoice. If you are an existing SoftLayer customer, once you upgrade your account you will receive a $200 Bluemix Applications/Services credit. One important note is that if you are a current Bluemix customer and you upgrade your account to access Bluemix Infrastructure, for now you will be billed in US Dollars, not your local currency.</p>\n<h2>Let us know what you think!</h2>\n<p>All of these enhancements are now available to all new customers as well as existing Bluemix trial and Pay-go customers and all existing SoftLayer customers.</p>\n<p>We’re really excited to share these enhancements with you and would love to know what you think so we can continue to improve Bluemix to make it the best cloud platform you’ll ever use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gregh-Bluemix-Front.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/10/bluemix-softlayer-unified-cloud-platform/","date":"2016-10-24T01:00:07","modified":"2016-12-07T16:27:40","format":"standard","slug":"bluemix-softlayer-unified-cloud-platform","guid":"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/?p=56423","excerpt":"<p>We are thrilled to share that you can now log into IBM Bluemix with your IBM ID and use a single UI experience to order and manage app runtimes, services, and infrastructure.

can use Code Starters to integrate common mobile services and key Bluemix services like Watson, Weather, IoT, and Cloudant, with a production-ready starting point. These Code Starters massively reduce the time it takes to get your mobile app running with Bluemix.</p>\n<p>To create a Bluemix Mobile Code Starter, navigate to the <i>Mobile</i> area of Bluemix and click Create Project.</p>\n<h2>Create a Bluemix Mobile Code Starter</h2>\n<p>There are a few basic steps to create a Code Starter project. We will use Object Storage in this walkthrough.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Choose a Code Starter</h3>\n<p>Choose from a catalog of Bluemix Mobile Code Starters, each focusing on a different service.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 80%;\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/meis_mobile_starters.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Use the <i>Preview</i> button and read the description of each starter to understand what it does. Select a starter and click <i>Create Project</i> to begin adding capabilities to your project.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Add capabilities</h3>\n<p>For example, you can add Mobile Analytics or Push Notifications to your project.<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 80%;\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/meis_mobile_starter_capabilities.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Bluemix Mobile will dynamically inject the selected mobile SDKs into your project when you download your code.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Get code</h3>\n<p>Download the code for iOS or Android and follow the instructions in the included README.md.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/meis_mobile_starter_download.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Configure the starter</h3>\n<p>Complete any additional steps in the README.md, which will be specific to the platform and starter that you chose. You may use any markdown viewer to see the README.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/meis_mobile_starter_readme.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>These steps are primarily dependency installation and key management instructions for non-mobile Bluemix services.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Run your project</h3>\n<p>Run your project from Xcode or Android Studio. Your running code is shown in a device emulator.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/object-storage-e1476387953818.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Bluemix Mobile Code Starters drastically reduce the number steps to create a production-ready mobile application.

as its replacement development language for the aging Objective-C. Swift is a modern language that mixes the best of features normally found in dynamic languages such as Python with a solid focus on safety. Developers targeting the Apple platforms have taken to Swift with impressive speed, and with Apple&#8217;s drive to open source the Swift tool chain and libraries, Swift is starting to take hold outside Apple&#8217;s platforms, too – and IBM is right there in the mix, driving the effort to port Swift to Linux. At Cloudant we&#8217;re huge fans of the language – Swift code is more readable, and much less error-prone than ObjC code.</p>\n<p>With the arrival of Swift 3, Xcode 8 and various Swift Web frameworks such as Kitura, there is a need for a better way to interact with Cloudant and CouchDB from Swift.</p>\n<h2>SwiftCloudant &#8211; fully open source and available</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" style=\"width: 200px;\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant1.png\" alt=\"\" /> SwiftCloudant, which is our official Swift client library now available as early release, was born during the development cycle for Swift 3, with the goal to create an asynchronous, operations-based API that feels &#8220;Swifty&#8221;.</p>\n<p>SwiftCloudant is based on the concept of Operations – a single operation performing a single action against a CouchDB/Cloudant instance, be it create a database, or create a query index.</p>\n<p>A core reason for using the operation approach is that it makes it easy for a user to create their own operations to access endpoints that aren&#8217;t supported yet. This extensible API means that in the future, as new endpoints are added, it is possible for users to begin using them without waiting for another release.</p>\n<p>SwiftCloudant embodies best practices such as using cookies for authentication also makes it as simple as possible to work with throughput-based plans which ask client to back off when request rate limits are hit.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing SwiftCloudant doesn&#8217;t fully support Swift on Linux, but Linux support is coming. Linux support has been a labour of love, and with thanks to Swift@IBM team (and some pushing from us!) the core technologies such as URLSession and Operation are almost API-compatible with Apple&#8217;s Platforms.</p>\n<p>Like all Cloudant&#8217;s client libraries, SwiftCloudant is fully open source, and available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudant/swift-cloudant\" target=\"_blank\">cloudant/swift-cloudant</a> project on GitHub.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/10/cloudant-api-for-swift/","date":"2016-10-19T00:15:07","modified":"2016-12-07T16:28:00","format":"standard","slug":"cloudant-api-for-swift","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=43389","excerpt":"<p>Developers targeting the Apple platforms have taken to Swift with impressive speed, and with Apple&#8217;s drive to open source the Swift tool chain and libraries, Swift is starting to take hold outside Apple&#8217;s platforms, too – and IBM is right there in the mix.

a while now, when you log into IBM Bluemix, you’ve probably seen a little link in the banner says, “Try the new Bluemix”.

You’re busy making awesome applications.</p>\n<p>Today, when you log in, I encourage you to <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">give the new experience a try</a>. Since February, when we first offered the link as an option, we’ve been testing, iterating, and improving the new experience daily based on user feedback. Based on what we’re hearing; I think you’re going to love it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bluemix-Home-Logged-In-1_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Curious what’s at the core of the new experience? Read on!</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>Our users demand a user interface that is fast… a user interface that responds to actions instantly. That is exactly what this new UI provides you. We’ve re-structured the UI into a micro-services architecture, and as a result, the UI can handle the incoming data you need to manage your cloud resources. This new experience is built to scale and grow to handle all the resources you need to manage (not to mention all the great additions we’re planning to add in the near future).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bluemix-Home-All-Items_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Focus</h3>\n<p>You are a builder. The resources you use to build your next great app needs to be in front of you. In addition, new resources you want to add need to be just a click away. This new experience offers a dashboard where you can see everything—or just a subset.</p>\n<p>This new experience also simplifies the catalog so you can view just categories of services you want, or search to see only what matches across categories. The result? A world of cognitive, analytics, mobile, IoT, DevOps, Security, and Integration services at your fingertips, without being overwhelmed with an endless list to browse through.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bluemix-Catalog-1_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Elegance</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had two years of user research, and our DevOps practice is to continually roll improvements our user experience. Sometimes, however, dramatic improvements take some time and require deeper changes we want to be sure are awesome before we deliver them. In fact, our whole “Try the new Bluemix” link was our A/B test to measure how quickly users could accomplish tasks depending on which UI they were using. We are now confident based on those measurements that all Bluemix users will become more efficient with the new experience.</p>\n<p>For example, when you drill into an app running in containers, here’s the new layout showing the most essential details and metrics at a glance:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ContainersDetails-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>And a lot more changes&#8230;</h2>\n<p>Here is a run-down of all changes you will see with the new Bluemix experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global header updated so you always see Docs, Organization and Space you are working in.</li>\n<li>Ability to click on any banner item for instant details. For example, by clicking in the top right banner, you can easily switch your account, region, organization, and space and even manage multiple organizations (and their user access controls) and create spaces.<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Org-Space-Switcher_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></li>\n<li>Redesigned catalog to find services faster with categories and global search</li>\n<li>Redesigned dashboard to see only what you want (or to see it all)</li>\n<li>Navigation Side-bar to focus into the active resources you need to manage. For example, in this figure You can view all applications or select only a specific type.<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LeftNavigation_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></li>\n<li>As you drill into each application, the “Details” view is now default, showing you a table of resources, and rich set of data about each resource instantly</li>\n<li>Design improvements across all of our compute/service instances</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are really excited to have you <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">try the new Bluemix experience</a>.

Glew","first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Glew","nickname":"cglew@us.ibm.com","slug":"cglewus-ibm-com","URL":"","avatar":"","description":"","registered":"2016-10-11T18:25:46+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/882","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/882/posts"}}},"content":"<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mongodb_compose_hero.png\" alt=\"\" /> When IBM acquired Compose in July 2015, we added many of Compose&#8217;s hosted databases to the Bluemix catalogue, but users were still required to visit the Compose website to configure their accounts separately. As of today, Compose’s entire roster of services is now available entirely through the Bluemix catalogue. This means that Bluemix customers can get a seamless experience when deploying Compose-hosted open source databases.</p>\n<p>Now you can <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=data\" target=\"_blank\">deploy MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, RethinkDB, etcd and RabbitMQ on Bluemix</a> with the click of a button. Each database is deployed into a 3-node cluster automatically and includes high-availability, automatic failover, daily backups (with weekly and monthly snapshots) and auto-scaling. With Compose, you can deploy a production-ready database in minutes.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t put off planning for database scalability</h2>\n<p>Databases are often the most neglected part of building new applications, especially for small teams or agile teams that have only so much time to spend on configuring and managing their data layers. Many devs will set up a database quickly, connect their app to it, and then manage it only if they have time. The difficulties come when it&#8217;s time to scale, or a new query causes slow queries, or there&#8217;s an outage and backups need to be restored. By deploying databases on Compose in HA configurations, with automatic backups, and auto-scaling from the get-go, developers can spend less time managing their databases and more time building their apps.</p>\n<p>Each Compose-hosted database, with the exception of the in-memory databases, is priced with 102 MB RAM and 1GBs storage. Customers are charged based on storage only. MongoDB, for example, begins at $31 per month and costs an additional $18/GB thereafter. In-memory databases, such as Redis, start with 256MB RAM and scale similarly. Compose&#8217;s autoscaling feature automatically increases RAM and storage simultaneously as you add more data so your app always has enough memory and IOPs to support even during unexpected peak usage.</p>\n<h2>Which Compose-hosted database is right for you?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to some of the databases that Compose offers, you might be wondering which ones you should choose for your project. For that, here is a short introduction to each database.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>PostgreSQL:</b> <a href=\"https://new-console.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-postgresql/\" target=\"_blank\">PostgreSQL</a> is currently the only SQL database Compose offers. PostgreSQL can be used for any situation that calls for a relational schema or requires transactions. PostgreSQL is a very mature, robust open source database and scales well for various types of applications. Note that PostgreSQL also provides for &#8220;schema-less&#8221; data storage through its JSON and JSONB data types.</li>\n<li><b>MongoDB:</b> <a href=\"https://new-console.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-mongodb/\" target=\"_blank\">MongoDB</a> is one of three document-type databases Compose currently offers (the other two are RethinkDB and Elasticsearch). The documents in MongoDB are expressed in JSON and arranged in collections within the database. If your application requires more speed than a relational database, will operate at the document level, and needs schema flexibility, then MongoDB is a great solution to choose. This flexibility and speed can be taken advantage of during rapid development and prototyping, before a more structured schema is settled on.</li>\n<li><b>RethinkDB:</b> <a href=\"https://new-console.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-rethinkdb/\" target=\"_blank\">RethinkDB</a> is also a document store that handles JSON documents, but it&#8217;s got some differentiating qualities from MongoDB. One of these is the language developed for use with RethinkDB: ReQL. ReQL is a robust query language that allows you to develop complex queries against your collections and within documents, even allowing for joins across tables (yes, it has the concept of tables).</li>\n<li><b>Elasticsearch:</b><br />\nAs the name implies, <a href=\"https://new-console.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-elasticsearch/\" target=\"_blank\">Elasticsearch</a> is great for search. Elasticsearch is a distributed database built on Apache Lucene, which underlies many web search engines. For documents stored in Elasticsearch, all fields in the documents are automatically indexed so complex queries can be used to retrieve the data. It also provides full-text search that supports auto-complete, contextual search, and multiple languages.</li>\n<li><strong>Redis:</strong> <a href=\"https://new-console.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-redis/\" target=\"_blank\">Redis</a> is an in-memory key/value store and its claim to fame is its lightning speed. Because of this, it is often used for data caching or even as a buffer while data moves through it to another source. Redis can be used for any application that requires instantaneous data operations, such as a chat application. We also recommend Redis because it&#8217;s the perfect companion to use with your other databases to take some of the load off of them and perform frequently-needed operations in-memory.</li>\n<li><strong>etcd (beta):</strong> Compose&#8217;s other key/value store is actually a distributed cluster configuration management service to help you build your application. At its simplest, etcd, currently in public beta, can be used just to manage the connection configuration information for your various data stores and application layers. <a href=\"https://new-console.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-etcd-beta/\" target=\"_blank\">etcd</a> uses the RAFT consensus algorithm to assure data consistency in your cluster and also enforces the order in which operations take place in the data so that every node in the cluster arrives at the same result in the same way.</li>\n<li><strong>RabbitMQ (beta):</strong> <a href=\"https://new-console.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-rabbitmq-beta/\" target=\"_blank\">RabbitMQ</a>, also currently in beta on Compose, is an open source distributed asynchronous message broker. It acts kind of like a temporary database for messages to pass through. It routes messages where they need to go and provides a temporary home until they can be picked up. It can be used for any situation where applications, databases, or other services need to communicate to each other asynchronously.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Give Compose-hosted open source databases a try!</h2>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve introduced you to Compose-hosted open source databases, it&#8217;s time to give them a try.

This version features exciting improvements and important changes that existing users are encouraged to review.</p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of the upgrade?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A Rule Designer that is easier to use</li>\n<li>Superior performance with Java 8 and a high performance decision engine</li>\n<li>Increased flexibility to design and deploy decision service content</li>\n<li>Alignment with IBM Operational Decision Manager (IBM ODM)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Rule Designer simplifies the path to both author rules and deploy operational decision services. This simple and straight path will aid in quick functionality tests while saving you valuable time to focus on more challenging cases. The existing rule projects that are using the legacy features can be easily migrated to the new path by using decision service projects and the decision engine.</p>\n<p>Decision service rule projects provide a better way to define which decision operations will be executed and how to deploy them. From just one decision service you can define multiple executable rule sets for both tests and production. The new service is aligned with the current version of <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.8.1/com.ibm.odm.distrib/kc_welcome_odm_distrib.html\">IBM ODM</a> and the rule projects are compatible both on premise and on cloud.</p>\n<p>The service also brings a new supported environment which includes a Rule Designer now based on Eclipse 4.4.2 (Luna), with added support for MacOS X. Rule Designer is now compatible with the Eclipse plugin for IBM Bluemix. The Business Rules service also supports Java 8 (IBM or Oracle), for better performance.</p>\n<h2>Upgrading to the new service</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and install the new Rule Designer <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/rules/index-gentopic1.html#rulov002\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Migrate from classic rule projects to decision service projects <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.8.1/com.ibm.odm.distrib.migrating/odm_topics/tsk_migrate_projects_to_ds.html\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Switch the decision service engine from classic rule engine to decision engine: in Rule Designer, open the properties of a decision service main rule project. From the rule engine tab, select decision engine.</li>\n<li>Create a new instance of the service. Any existing Business Rule instance that was started before October 6th will remain on the previous service version. You will need to delete any older instance.</li>\n<li>Deploy decision service ruleApps to the new service instance. Rulesets are now defined through decision operations and ruleApps are defined and deployed from deployment configurations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is recommended that you install the new Rule Designer in a separate folder from any previous instance, while still keeping the previous version. You will also want to create a new workspace and copy and import any existing rule projects. Rule App projects and Rule Execution Server Configuration projects are no longer necessary. They will need to be replaced by deployment configuration elements in decision service projects.</p>\n<h2>Need help?</h2>\n<p>For additional assistance, please see the Business Rules service <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/rules/rules.html#rules\">documentation</a> or submit your question on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=ibm-bluemix%2cbusiness-rules\">Stack Overflow</a> using the <code>#ibm-bluemix</code> and <code>#business-rules</code> tags.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/10/business-rules-service-upgrade/","date":"2016-10-07T09:00:22","modified":"2016-12-07T16:28:06","format":"standard","slug":"business-rules-service-upgrade","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=43434","excerpt":"<p>A new version of the Business Rules service is available.

The new feature utilizes machine learning technology to recognize visual content and organizes collections of images accordingly.</p>\n<p>Users can upload their own collection of images and the service will then return the top 100 most similar images. Similarity search can be utilized for any purpose, and users can custom train the service on collections of up to 1 million images each.</p>\n<h2>Similarity Search Tackles Retail</h2>\n<p>Our customers are already using Visual Recognition similarity search to enhance retail experiences.

to make AI systems compassionate. With this goal in mind, early this year IBM Watson released textual emotion detection as a new functionality within the <a href=\"https://alchemy-language-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Alchemy Language Service</a> and <a href=\"https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Tone Analyzer</a> on the Watson developer cloud.</p>\n<p>We are pleased to announce that IBM Watson’s emotion detection capability has undergone significant enhancements. These new enhancements were built on the ensemble framework described in the <a href=\"http://blog.alchemyapi.com/a-step-closer-to-building-empathetic-systems\" target=\"_blank\">previous article</a>. These enhancements will remain pivotal in improving user interactions, and understanding their emotional state.</p>\n<h2>What are the new enhancements?</h2>\n<p>Newly released emotion model brings following enhancements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Expansion in the training data:</b> We doubled our training dataset from the previous release. Systematic expansion of the training dataset has helped the new model to significantly improve its vocabulary coverage than before.</li>\n<li><b>New feature selection process:</b> Feature selection is one of the most important steps in building a large scale machine learning system. In this release, we explore some linear models penalized with the L1 norm to have coefficients of important features to be non-zero. Based on our experiments, we find that Linear SVM with L1 penalty helped most to extract important features. These selected features along with topic and specialized engineered features helped classifiers in the ensemble model not only to improve accuracy but also to provide transparency for the final prediction.</li>\n<li><b>Diverse classifiers:</b> The ensemble framework performs better when it contains diverse set of classifiers in it. In this release we bring a new set of diverse classifiers exploring different hypotheses, including tree-based ensemble classifiers, kernel-based classifiers, and latent topic-based classifiers. Since training data is continuously increasing, this diverse set of classifiers has to address the scalability problem before being incorporated into our ensemble framework.</li>\n<li><b>Improved lexicon support:</b> Our new release significantly improved emotion detection at lexicon/word-level.</li>\n<li><b>Expanded support for emoticons, emojis and slang:</b> This is an important step for detecting emotions in conversational systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these enhancements helped us achieve improved accuracy (in terms of average F1-measure), which is better than the state of the art emotion models [Li et. Al 2009, Kim et.al 2010, Liu 2012, Agrawal and An 2012, Wang and Pal 2015] included in our previous version. Some of these state-of-the art emotion models are part of our ensemble framework.</p>\n<p>This is the current state of our work at the time of this release. We are continuously improving our models and look forward to releasing enhanced models in the future.</p>\n<h2>Ready to try a demo?</h2>\n<p>Check out these fun (and possibly insightful) service demonstrations:</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://alchemy-language-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">AlchemyLanguage demo</a></p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Tone Analyzer demo</a></p>\n<p>The API is currently available for English text input.

width=\"280\" height=\"320\" />Today, we’re announcing the general availability of <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-bluemix--lift\">IBM Bluemix Lift.</a> This is our self-service, ground to cloud, database migration offering.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Talk to any database admin and they’ll all tell you the same thing: There is nothing sexy about a database migration.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Database migration is arguably the least interesting and most dreaded part of every database admin’s job. Consider the challenges &#8211; months of time spent coming up with air-tight migration plans that get tossed out the window as soon as the migration starts. Weeks spent debating the pros and cons of an approach, only to realize that you’re forced to choose the least bad way to disrupt your business. And then there’s the days and weeks spent doing the actual migration.</p>\n<p>Data movement to the cloud adds a fresh layer of complexity. It takes a long time to move tens or hundreds of terabytes across the Internet. Your shop can’t afford to take a month’s vacation. The databases powering your business have to keep running, always. And when you’re moving proprietary data across a public medium, the possibility of a costly and embarrassing data breach keeps you up at night.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the opportunity cost. Spending months planning out migrations means you’re not focusing on the day-to-day that’s keeping the business running smoothly. It’s simply overhead. It’s time not well spent, and time not spent doing productive work. Nobody wants that, no matter your role or profession.</p>\n<h2>IBM Bluemix Lift will revolutionize database migration</h2>\n<p>This is the database migration status quo. It’s not a great experience, and we’re going to revolutionize it. IBM Bluemix Lift is how you’re going to get your data into your cloud database, and it’s going to feel like &#8220;magic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We’re making the entire process as fast, secure, and reliable as possible. Here’s what that means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast: Lift accelerates data transfer by embedding IBM’s Aspera technology. Aspera’s patented and highly efficient bulk data transport protocol allows Lift to achieve transport speeds tens of times faster than FTP and HTTP. Moving 10TB of data could take a little over a day, depending on your network connection. In other words, data transfer with Lift is blazing fast.</li>\n<li>Zero-downtime: Lift eliminates the downtime associated with database migrations. We use IBM’s world-class change capture technology to track incremental changes to your source database and replay them to your target database. That means that any applications using the source database can keep running uninterrupted while the database migration is in progress.</li>\n<li>Secure: Any data movement across the Internet requires strong encryption so that your data is never compromised. Lift encrypts your data as it travels across the Web, on its way to your IBM cloud data property.</li>\n<li>Easy to use: Set up your source data connection, provide credentials to your target database, verify schema compatibility with your target database engine, and hit run. That’s all it takes to kick off a database migration with Lift.</li>\n<li>Reliable: The Lift service automatically recovers from problems encountered during data extract, transport and load. If your migration is interrupted due to a drop in network connectivity, Lift will automatically resume once connectivity returns. In other words, you can kick off a large database migration and walk away knowing that Lift is on the job.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Speed, zero-downtime, security, ease of use, and reliability — these are the hallmarks of a great database migration service. And this is exactly what we’ve built with Lift.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50362\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM_Bluemix_Lift_Twittercard.png\" alt=\"ibm_bluemix_lift_twittercard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM_Bluemix_Lift_Twittercard-300x150.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM_Bluemix_Lift_Twittercard-768x384.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IBM_Bluemix_Lift_Twittercard.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lift provides an amazing jumping off point for new capabilities we’ll be adding in the future — new source/target databases, more automation and more use-cases.

In a previous <a href=\"blogs/bluemix/2016/07/26/cloudant-public-improved-pricing-model/\">blog post</a>, we shared the reasons for the change and what is happening to the Cloudant Shared plan. Now that the plans are live, we are sharing a bit more detail on using Cloudant under this new pricing model.</p>\n<p><b>What is happening with the Cloudant Shared plan?</b></p>\n<p>As of today, September 27, 2016, you will have 30 days to provision new Shared plan instances. On October 27, 2016, the Shared plan will no longer be available for new service instances, in favor of the new Lite and Standard plans. IBM Cloudant will continue to support existing Cloudant Shared plan instances for a minimum of one year until September 27, 2017.</p>\n<p><b>How does the pricing work for Cloudant Lite and Standard plans?</b></p>\n<p>Cloudant pricing is based on two major metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provisioned throughput capacity</li>\n<li>Data usage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The provisioned throughput capacity is a per second metric and is broken out between three request classes: lookups, writes, and query. Lookups are single doc reads, writes include doc and index writes, and queries include any read to a Cloudant index. See the latest updates to the <a href=\"https://docs.cloudant.com/bluemix.html#bluemix-public\" target=\"_new\">Cloudant documentation</a> for details on what API requests make up each of these request classes. The data usage consists of both primary data and indexes.</p>\n<p>Cloudant now comes in two plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lite</li>\n<li>Standard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Lite plan can be provisioned if you want to evaluate Cloudant and comes with a fixed provisioned throughput capacity and 1GB of data storage. The Lite plan will be perpetually free and you won&#8217;t be charged unless you opt in to the paid Standard plan. The Standard plan comes with a increased provisioned throughput capacity to start and includes 20GB of data usage. You can scale the provisioned throughput capacity to meet the needs of your application, and pay for data usage as volume grows beyond the included 20GB.</p>\n<p>Pricing is based on per hour allotment of these metrics, with approximate monthly charges shown in the Bluemix UI. Check out the <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/\" target=\"_new\">Bluemix Public catalog tile</a> for Cloudant and the <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/pricing/\" target=\"_new\">Bluemix Pricing</a> page for detailed pricing information.</p>\n<p><b>How do I change between the Lite and Standard plans and adjust my provisioned throughput capacity?</b></p>\n<p>You can change between the free Lite and paid Standard plans for a specific Cloudant instance within the Bluemix Dashboard. You will be prompted as shown below to ensure you want to make this change.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50538 size-large\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bluemix-cloudant-plans-1024x478.png\" alt=\"bluemix-cloudant-plans\" width=\"680\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bluemix-cloudant-plans-300x140.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bluemix-cloudant-plans-768x359.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bluemix-cloudant-plans-1024x478.png 1024w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bluemix-cloudant-plans.png 1582w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p>Once you have chosen the paid Standard plan, go to the Account tab on the Cloudant Dashboard to adjust the provisioned throughput capacity to meet the requirements of your application. Cloudant has three specific self-service capacity settings for you to choose from. If a larger capacity is required, hit the Contact Support button, and open a support case with details on the required capacity for your Cloudant account and we will set it up.</p>\n<p><b><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50551 size-large\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-capacity-1024x535.png\" alt=\"cloudant-capacity\" width=\"680\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-capacity-300x157.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-capacity-768x401.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-capacity.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></b></p>\n<p><b>How do I view my current consumption of the provisioned throughput capacity?</b></p>\n<p>In the Cloudant Dashboard, the Usage section is now a top tier tab. You can see a real-time view of usage against your set provisioned throughput capacity for lookups, writes, and queries. The bars will turn red when you reach the maximum throughput capacity. You can also see an overtime view of data storage, broken down by primary database data, and for the index types of views (MapReduce), Search, and Geospatial.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-50555\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-usage-1024x530.png\" alt=\"cloudant-usage\" width=\"680\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-usage-300x155.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-usage-768x397.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-usage-1024x530.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p><b>What changes are in the Cloudant API?</b></p>\n<p>Cloudant Lite and Standard plans have a set provisioned throughput capacity of lookups/sec, writes/sec, and queries/sec. If your usage of Cloudant exceeds one of the thresholds, you will receive a 429 response code stating &#8220;too many requests&#8221; for the given request class. See example below of a script that is writing documents to the Cloudant API and periodically hitting the 429 too_many_requests error.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50550\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-api-429-response.png\" alt=\"cloudant-api-429-response\" width=\"715\" height=\"246\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-api-429-response-300x103.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-api-429-response-768x264.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cloudant-api-429-response.png 977w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px\" /></p>\n<p>You should ensure that your application uses staggered retry logic when encountering the 429 response code. Cloudant&#8217;s official client libraries for <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudant/java-cloudant\" target=\"_new\">java</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudant/nodejs-cloudant#request-plugins\" target=\"_new\">node</a>, and <a href=\"http://python-cloudant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adapters.html?highlight=#cloudant.adapters.Replay429Adapter\" target=\"_new\">python</a> have the capability to retry requests that come back with a 429 response if your application is only temporarily over the plan&#8217;s limit. Note that if your application persistently exceeds its allocated provisioned throughput capacity, you should move to a larger allocation to avoid application issues. Additionally, the maximum request body size to an API request for Cloudant is 1MB and you will receive a 413 response code stating &#8220;the request entity is too large&#8221; if you exceed it. For more details, see the <a href=\"https://docs.cloudant.com/bluemix.html#bluemix-public\" target=\"_new\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><b>What if I require data isolation or a specific data center location?</b></p>\n<p>Cloudant Lite and Standard plan instances can be provisioned immediately in each of the Bluemix Public regions of US South, United Kingdom, and Sydney. If you require an isolated environment for your Cloudant instances due to specific security or compliance reasons, such as HIPAA, you can choose the Cloudant Enterprise plan from the Bluemix catalog and request it.

as of September 26th, 2016, a new rebranded Language Translation™ service tile called <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/language-translator\">Language Translator™</a> was released on Bluemix. Similar to the Language Translation Service, the Language Translator provides domain-specific translation by using Statistical Machine Translation techniques that have been perfected in research labs over the past few decades. It uses the same programming interfaces as the existing Language Translation service, and simplified pricing plans.</p>\n<h2>What you need to know</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Language Translator service tile is generally available in the Bluemix Catalog. This service is technically identical to the Language Translation service you use today, but it includes both a name change and a simplified pricing structure. You can expect some pricing components to be even cheaper.</li>\n<li>On November 1st, 2016, the Language Translation tile will be marked private within the Bluemix catalog. All new instances of the service will be provided under the new Language Translator tile thereafter.</li>\n<li>For a period of one year, through November 1st, 2017, all existing provisioned instances under the Language Translation tile will continue to be available to users through their Bluemix dashboard, and will be supported by the Language Translation team.</li>\n<li>Any instance under the Language Translation tile that has not been migrated to the new Language Translator tile as of November 1st, 2017 will be deleted by the Language Translation team.</li>\n<li>Users are therefore encouraged to migrate to the new Language Translator tile as soon as possible. Please see the migrations instructions <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/language-translator/migrating.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about the transition from Language Translation to Language Translator, and the new pricing structure, visit <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/?p=40244\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, we’re here to help!

May 2016, toolchains became part of IBM Bluemix <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/2016/06/16/open-toolchain-with-ibm-bluemix-devops-services/\" target=\"_blank\">as an experimental feature</a>. Teams that are striving to improve the velocity and quality of software delivery select many tools from disparate vendors for their toolchains. Teams at IBM are no different; you can read about their experiences on the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/devops/method\" target=\"_blank\">Bluemix Garage Method site</a>. Those teams needed a way to manage the complexity of provisioning, integrating, and working with toolchains. As a result, toolchains on Bluemix were designed with these goals in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give team members a central place to find tools and monitor significant events, such as failures in the delivery pipeline</li>\n<li>Automate the integration of tools when a team adds a tool to its toolchain</li>\n<li>Give enterprises the ability to capture successful toolchain patterns in templates that can be provisioned in a repeatable way</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_create_toolchain_edited.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50526\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-50526\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_create_toolchain_edited.png\" alt=\"beta_create_toolchain_edited\" width=\"740\" height=\"598\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_create_toolchain_edited-300x243.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_create_toolchain_edited-768x621.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_create_toolchain_edited.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>During the experimental phase of the toolchains release, the toolchains squad learned a lot from users about the tools they use, the integrations they need, and how enterprises are challenged by the tension between standardization and flexibility. Today, the toolchains feature is being promoted to a beta release.</p>\n<h2>Tool integration available today and more on the way</h2>\n<p>You’ve requested many specific tool integrations, which the toolchains squad is prioritizing. New tools will be added incrementally. One new feature in the beta release is the ability to integrate any tool into your toolchain. While many teams are selecting newer tools for various DevOps functions, every team still uses established tools that are often on-premises, and those tools need to be part of the toolchain, too. You can add those tools to a toolchain by going to the tool integration list and clicking <i>Other tool</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/other_tool-edited.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50618\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-50618\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/other_tool-edited.png\" alt=\"other_tool-edited\" width=\"740\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/other_tool-edited-300x184.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/other_tool-edited-768x471.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/other_tool-edited.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>One central tool to a continuous delivery process is a delivery pipeline. You can use the <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/delivery-pipeline-next/\">Delivery Pipeline Next</a> service to define and automate the sequence of build, deployment, and testing activities to deliver code changes from development to production. You can configure one or more stages and the triggers that move from one stage to the next. This beta release introduces a new, streamlined flow to create a simple pipeline that builds and deploys your code to Bluemix.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_pipeline_dashboard_edited.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50529\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-50529\" src=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_pipeline_dashboard_edited.png\" alt=\"beta_pipeline_dashboard_edited\" width=\"740\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_pipeline_dashboard_edited-300x130.png 300w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_pipeline_dashboard_edited-768x332.png 768w, https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beta_pipeline_dashboard_edited.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As other tools are added to the toolchain, they become available in the pipeline and aware of pipeline events, such as successful or failed deployments.

If you&#8217;ve used the existing Delivery Pipeline service, the Delivery Pipeline Next service will seem familiar. It has the same pipeline features that you&#8217;re used to, plus new flexibility to create pipelines either as part of toolchains or as independent build and deployment systems.</p>\n<p>To set up a pipeline, go to the service catalog, select Delivery Pipeline Next, and you&#8217;re on your way. You can also add pipelines to your toolchains. Most toolchain templates contain pipelines, and you can add more pipelines as tool integrations. As always, you can import code directly from GitHub and create a pipeline for that code.</p>\n<p>For example, see this project that deploys a Node.js application to Bluemix containers:</p>\n<p><a

class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/swift_announcement_hero.png\" alt=\"\" /> The power of the popular Swift development language is officially available on the server. As developers, we are lucky if we begin working early with a technology that companies will want to invest in for the next decade. Swift on the server shows the signs of being one of those technologies.</p>\n<p>What are those signs?</p>\n<p><b>Sound technical underpinnings</b>: Swift is a modern, strongly-typed and compiled language that offers concise syntax, great performance, and low memory usage. And Swift encourages developers to change and extend code with the confidence of knowing the language will help catch any errors along the way.</p>\n<p><b>Strategic relevance in meeting market demands</b>: With Swift, developers are creating amazing new mobile applications that change the way we live and work. With Swift in the Cloud, mobile client developers gain much easier access to cloud-based cognitive, data, social, and other services for enhancing user experiences.</p>\n<p><b>Developers having fun</b>: This is due at least in part to Swift offering the advantages of a scripting language with the safety and performance advantages of a compiled language.</p>\n<h2>Three important milestones for Swift on the server</h2>\n<p>At this moment in the evolution of the Swift language, we are excited to announce three important milestones in unlocking the power of Swift on the server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Swift 3.0:</b> Since the Swift language became an open source project last December (<a href=\"http://swift.org\" target=\"_blank\">swift.org/</a>), the community has worked towards this first open source release of Swift, which now includes <a href=\"https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-0-released/\">server side support along with a number of language improvements</a>. Having heavily invested effort in preparing for this release, beginning with the porting and maturing of the key core libraries of Foundation and Libdispatch, the Swift community now has a much greater language and library consistency across macOS and Linux.</li>\n<li><b>Kitura 1.0:</b> At the same time, leveraging the work in Foundation and libdispatch, IBM has also led the development of the Kitura web framework, which offers a seamless developer experience across client and server environments. Since February, when we invited the community to participate in developing Kitura, the response has been amazing. Please join us either as a user or collaborator as we continue the effort to make Kitura the default, enterprise-grade Swift framework for the cloud. To coincide with the release of Swift 3.0, we are please to announce Kitura 1.0, which has everything you need to work on web services from the server side with Swift.</li>\n<li><b>IBM Bluemix Runtime for Swift (GA):</b> IBM gladly announces general availability of the IBM Bluemix Runtime for Swift. By including the latest Swift tools and taking care of system dependencies, this runtime allows you to focus on writing your server-side Swift services.

class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/key-protect-mini-hero.png\" alt=\"\" /> Every enterprise has sensitive information which it would like to protect from unauthorized access or accidental insider release. Organizations are rapidly adopting the Cloud as a mechanism to develop and deploy new innovative technologies. Various types of data are now moving into the Cloud and they all have different protection requirements.</p>\n<p>In order to support this trend security executives are looking to create best practices to support cloud data security governance protocols while avoiding solutions which require the addition of highly-skilled resources and increased operational budgets. In addition, there are hundreds of data security options from dozens of vendors to pick and choose from. As a result security professionals are spending lots of sleepless nights trying to figure out how to manage and protect their data migration. What is the answer?</p>\n<p>In reality there is no easy answer. Each organization has a unique set of challenges when it comes to securing sensitive data. Nevertheless, internal company data management guidelines, industry best practices, and government regulations are increasingly requiring the use of data encryption and encryption key management to be included as fundamental components of overall data storage, data management, and data governance.</p>\n<h2>Provision encrypted keys for apps across Bluemix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/key-protect/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Key Protect</a> is a cloud-based, multi-tenant encryption key management service with key-vaulting provided by cloud-based HSMs (hardware security modules). IBM Key Protect manages the entire life-cycle of keys from creation through storage, application use, and destruction, while also enforcing separation of duties between data management and key management. IBM Key Protect not only helps you secure your cloud with sensitive data encryption; but, also supports both internal and external compliance auditing policies by providing the mandatory control of user access requests to create, open, or delete encryption keys.</p>\n<p>There are two factors driving organizations to focus resources toward adopting more data encryption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Strengthen Security</em>: Businesses need to enhance data security in order to minimize the risk of data compromise or inadvertent exposure. Industry surveys identify the top three threats to sensitive data as: employee mistakes, system malfunction, and hackers. In 2015 the Identity Theft Resource Center reported that there were 781 security breaches while the Ponemon Institute estimates that the global average cost to a company for a security breach is $4.0M. 2016 figures are trending higher. The breadth and cost of data breaches are sky rocketing.</li>\n<li><em>Ensure Regulatory Compliance</em>: Organizations must comply with all relevant data protection standards, directives, and regulations (whether industry or government mandated). Compliance is not a static event; but, rather an ongoing effort requiring nimble adaption to changing rules, regulation definitions, auditor findings, and executive mandates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IBM Key Protect is a simple, scalable encryption key management service which provides an economical and easy to manage solution to help you protect your data at rest in the IBM Cloud. It allows users to create keys to encrypt data at various levels, provides the ability to control access to their keys, and then manage the life-cycle of those keys. Once there is no longer a need to secure the data the keys can be deleted without any residual copies remaining, thereby rendering any data encrypted under those keys cryptographically erased. When encryption keys are deleted, you can be assured your data is no longer retrievable, regardless of the application or cloud that stored it.</p>\n<p>IBM Key Protect provides security professionals with an operational best practice process to help secure sensitive data from exposure while supporting their data protection regulatory compliance guidelines.</p>\n<h2>Start using IBM Key Protect today!</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/key-protect-mini-hero.png\" alt=\"\" /> IBM Key Protect is now available as a BETA service on IBM Bluemix-Public in the Dallas region.</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/key-protect/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Key Protect in Bluemix catalog</a></p>\n<p>This service provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encryption-capable block storage, object storage, database, or internal application to use REST APIs for integrating encryption capabilities with IBM Key Protect eliminating the need to spend the time or effort building proprietary (and often insecure) solutions to protect encryption keys.</li>\n<li>Built-in security based upon ridged FIPS-140-2 Level 2 certified hardware security modules (HSM) located within secure IBM SoftLayer data centers.</li>\n<li>Cloud IT security administrators the ability to easily manage their encryption keys while creating roll-based employee access to data via a simple graphical user interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Look for the IBM Key Protect icon under the Security section in the IBM Bluemix-Public Dallas Region catalogue.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/09/announcing-ibm-key-protect-beta/","date":"2016-09-19T12:00:16","modified":"2016-12-07T16:28:41","format":"standard","slug":"announcing-ibm-key-protect-beta","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=41114","excerpt":"<p>IBM Key Protect is a simple, scalable encryption key management service which provides an economical and easy to manage solution to help you protect your data at rest in the IBM Cloud.

Local and IBM Bluemix Dedicated instances beginning August 30, 2016. IBM Containers is a fully managed Containers as a Service (CaaS) offering built on open-source Docker technology. The experience begins for users with deploying their first container or pushing an existing image to their private, hosted registry; all using native Docker CLI and APIs ensuring an easy transition to IBM Containers and portability of all Docker images and Dockerfiles.</p>\n<p>See the post &#8220;<a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/09/30/ibm-containers-launch-london/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Containers Launch in London</a>&#8221; to learn about all of the enterprise-grade capabilities we&#8217;ve added to the open-source Docker technology as well as how to get started with IBM Containers capabilities in the public cloud.</p>\n<h2>What is IBM Bluemix?</h2>\n<p>Bluemix was announced in June 2014 as the IBM Cloud platform, providing users with a variety of compute choices as well as over 140 IBM and third party services. Each compute choice is built on open standards, from Cloud Foundry to Docker Containers to OpenStack Virtual Machines to OpenWhisk. See &#8220;<a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/08/05/bluemix-instant-runtimes-containers-or-virtual-machines/\" target=\"_blank\">Bluemix OpenWhisk, Instant Runtimes, Containers or Virtual Servers?</a>&#8221; to learn about your compute choices.</p>\n<h2>What is Bluemix Dedicated and Bluemix Local?</h2>\n<p>IBM values choice for our customers, that&#8217;s why IBM offers different cloud options so our customers can build an optimal solution for their particular use case. In addition to the multi-tenant, shared resources, public cloud offering that supports each of the compute choices, there are two other delivery models for Bluemix:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Bluemix Dedicated</b>: This delivery model is a single-tenant Bluemix instance running in an IBM DataCenter. This offering was announced in November 2014.</li>\n<li><b>Bluemix Local</b>: This delivery model is a single-tenant Bluemix instance running on your hardware in your datacenter, but still a fully managed cloud service provided by IBM. This was announced in October 2015.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A more comprehensive explanation of these models and examples are available in the solution guide &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/forms/guide-building-a-hybrid-cloud-with-bluemix.html\">Building a hybrid cloud with Bluemix</a>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Today we are making IBM Containers available in the two delivery models above, Bluemix Dedicated and Bluemix Local.

More than 500 of you were with us throughout the past few months, rapidly shifting your VMware environments to the IBM Cloud.</p>\n<p>Why? It’s simple. That massively growing number of early adopters took minutes, instead of months, to move their existing workloads from on-premises to the IBM Cloud. You know what they didn’t take with them? The cost of retooling and all those security worries and risks that they had around workload migrations.</p>\n<p>As I look across the floor and see the phones ringing and our digital sales team furiously keying in chats, it’s exciting to see the rapid adoption but frankly, not surprising.</p>\n<p>Here are three things that those clients saw:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Reduced stress levels caused by heightened security.</b>IBM and VMware solutions can accelerate hybrid cloud adoption, enabling you to avoid retooling expenses, alleviate development risks and reduce security concerns. On top of that we have new partners such as HyTrust for virtualization security, Veeam Software for data recovery and Zerto, which protects business critical applications.</li>\n<li><b>Enjoyed weeks back in their life.</b>Where you going to do with your four to six weeks that you saved? Let me suggest you spend the time reflecting on the fact that our new while you lay in the hammock that you created out of old server cables. Thank you, automation technology.</li>\n<li><strong>Delighted customers with better experiences.</strong>The next time you need to get a new update or feature out to your customers, you can do it at cloud speed. Our IBM and VMware solutions make sure that you will have an integrated hybrid approach and are built to support new business models more quickly. You can make use of a mix of hybrid cloud and automation to support agile development for new apps, with continuous improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our clients are using IBM and VMware solutions to create innovative apps that make their customers’ lives easier.</p>\n<p>So if you haven’t already, add IBM and VMware to your personal lexicon of perfect pairings.

href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/04/29/mobile-analytics-for-bluemix-service/\">blogged</a> about a nifty new experimental service called Mobile Analytics for Bluemix that allows app owners, product managers, and developers to easily monitor how their mobile app is doing. I am pleased to announce this service is now available in beta.</p>\n<p>The Mobile Analytics beta service offers user, session, and crash metrics and alerts that can easily be integrated into new or existing apps. It is one of a growing family of core mobile IBM services for Bluemix that includes Push Notifications, Mobile Client Access for security, and Mobile Quality Assurance for quality tracking. The service can connect directly to any mobile app using the Bluemix Mobile Services SDKs or REST APIs, and in addition, the beta service can display data from apps instrumented with MobileFirst Platform Foundation SDK.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/blog/2016/07/11/analytics-bm-service/\">Configuring Mobile Analytics and Mobile Foundation Bluemix services</a> for more details.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mobile-analytics-beta-screenshot1_edited.png\" alt=\"mobile-analytics-beta-screenshot1\" /></p>\n<h3>What has changed from experimental to beta?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike the experimental service, which retained data for only 3 days, the beta service will retain data for at least 30 days.</li>\n<li>The console has been re-arranged so that you can more easily find the metrics you are looking for and to make room for future growth.</li>\n<li>The beta service has a more robust architecture to make it more reliable and scalable.</li>\n<li>The service has a new icon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>There are only a few charts in the beta service. What is planned for the future?</h3>\n<p>I can’t tell you all we have planned for Mobile Analytics in the near future, but I can tell you our roadmap contains a long list of metrics and capabilities that we will continuously deliver in the coming weeks, so stay tuned. The beta is just a taste of things to come.</p>\n<h2>We need your input!</h2>\n<p>You can shape the future of Mobile Analytics for Bluemix.

DevOps teams worry about? An outage or slow down that frustrates users to the point that they quit the application and move on to a competitor. You&#8217;ve likely seen the impact of outages on some of the most popular applications in the world, such as Netflix, Apple, Uber, and the most recent gaming phenomenon, Pokémon Go.</p>\n<p>As DevOps teams deploy continuous updates to their applications, often multiple times a day, they must continuously ensure that their changes do not degrade performance. Teams must be aware of impending issues so that they can fix them before users notice them. At the same time, teams don&#8217;t have time to configure, set up, and maintain a set of complex tools to monitor continuously.</p>\n<h2>Maximize uptime and user satisfaction of applications</h2>\n<p>The solution to this problem is the IBM® Bluemix® Availability Monitoring service. The service is native to the Bluemix platform and maximizes the uptime and user satisfaction of applications wherever they are deployed &#8211; in development, test, staging, or production. Tightly integrated into the DevOps lifecycle, the service proactively runs simulated tests from around the world, around the clock, to detect, isolate, and diagnose performance issues.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2016/08/9MonitoringMap.jpg\" alt=\"Availability Monitoring map\" /></p>\n<h3>Capabilities of the Availability Monitoring service</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorporated into the DevOps lifecycle as part of the delivery pipeline</li>\n<li>Can be set up in less than 5 minutes from the <strong>Monitoring</strong> tab of any of your Cloud Foundry applications</li>\n<li>Runs simulated synthetic tests from locations around the world, as often as once per minute, to test these actions:\n<ul>\n<li>Webpage loads</li>\n<li>REST API calls</li>\n<li>Simulated user interactions through Selenium scripts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Monitors not only your application, but also the services that it depends on</li>\n<li>Alerts users of issues through their preferred channel of notification, such as email, Slack, or SMS</li>\n<li>Helps identify whether an issue was caused by an application deployment or change by presenting an auto-correlated view of alerts, metrics, and deployment activities</li>\n<li>Diagnoses the exact step of failure by providing waterfall analysis that pinpoints slow requests, broken links, large images, slow external API calls, and more</li>\n<li>Accelerates diagnosis with an automated browser capture of the failure</li>\n<li>Provides daily, weekly, and monthly scores to ensure that target uptime and user satisfaction goals are being met</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!--<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6R7uiyKaPRo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>--></p>\n<div data-videoid=\"6R7uiyKaPRo\" data-videotype=\"youtube\" data-imagesize=\"medium\" data-widget=\"videoplayer\" id=\"ytp1test\">Watch the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R7uiyKaPRo) </div>\n<p><!-- To learn more, watch these videos:\n\n<ul>\n\t\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6R7uiyKaPRo\" target=\"_blank\">Tell me why</a></li>\n\n\n\t\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NhQGWi4Y6uo\" target=\"_blank\">Show me how</a></li>\n\n\n</ul>\n\n\n--></p>\n<h3>Availability Monitoring versus Monitoring and Analytics</h3>\n<p>You might be wondering: how does this service compare to <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/monitoring-and-analytics/\">IBM Monitoring and Analytics for Bluemix</a>? The Monitoring and Analytics service monitors runtimes and how they impact an application. With that service, you can narrow down to the line of code that is causing an issue. The <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/availability-monitoring/\">Availability Monitoring service</a> monitors availability and performance by using synthetic tests from around the world. The capabilities that the services provide are complementary, and the services can co-exist.</p>\n<h2>Try the Availability Monitoring service today!</h2>\n<p>The Availability Monitoring service is available as a beta offering on Bluemix Public; you can find it in the DevOps category. To access the service, in any of your Cloud Foundry applications, click the <strong>Monitoring</strong> tab.

class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/activeDeployIcon-200x.png\" alt=\"\" /> As this is my first blog and you may be reading about the Active Deploy service for the first time, let me quickly summarize how this service can help you easily manage updates to your application without downtime to improve the availability of your application. Then I&#8217;ll introduce a new feature called the <i>Resource Optimized Deployment</i> option.</p>\n<h2>How Active Deploy handles zero-downtime updates</h2>\n<p>Active Deploy enables zero-downtime deployments for your Cloud Foundry apps or IBM container based applications. To do that, users provide Active Deploy with two versions of their application – an old version and a new version. Active Deploy will control the network traffic to each of your versions for you, and allow you to progressively migrate from the old version to the new version without impacting clients accessing your application.</p>\n<p>The original version of Active Deploy implemented this with a rapid fallback deployment model, which maintains duplicate copies of the old and new version to allow rapid fallback to the old version. In the beginning, Active Deploy will scale your new version up to the number of instances used by the old version.</p>\n<p>Once the new version is scaled up, we redirect traffic from the old version, so that for a limited time, all traffic is routed to the new version for testing purposes. Instances of the old version are kept to be able to quickly switch back in case there is an issue with the new version. If this testing time is finished successfully, the new version is considered stable and the instances of the old version gets scaled down and can be removed.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s new?</h2>\n<p>With this background, I&#8217;m proud to announce that we just deployed a new feature, called Resource Optimized Deployment. Resource optimized deployment uses fewer overall resources because it allows simultaneous up and downscale of your old and new versions. This reduces your maximum resource consumption to only <i>n+1</i> instead of <i>2*n</i> with <i>n</i> being the number of instances of the old version. For example:</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Old Version</th>\n<th>New Version</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>4 instances</td>\n<td>1 instance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3 instances</td>\n<td>2 instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2 instances</td>\n<td>3 instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1 instances</td>\n<td>4 instances</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>There is a trade-off with time if you utilize the Resource Optimized Deployment option to reduce your maximum resource consumption. In case of a failure with the new version, the old version is already scaled down and will need to be scaled up again to the required load and level of availability.</p>\n<p>Beyond building the resource optimized deployment option the Active Deployment development team has also worked in the area of service reliability by doing retries on internal REST requests and API calls. We would love to hear your input on how we can improve Active Deploy. Send us your thoughts and we’ll take your feedback into consideration as we release new features into production. We are always adding new capabilities so stay tuned for other exciting enhancements&#8230;.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ActiveDeploy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Getting started with the Active Deploy service</a> (official docs)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ActiveDeploy/tutorial.html#tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">Tutorials for Active Deploy</a> (official docs)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmsZ4-Mj_pU\" target=\"_blank\">Bluemix Active Deploy &#8211; Zero-Downtime Deployment</a> (video introduction)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/03/17/bluemix-active-deploy-with-pipeline-integration/\">Bluemix Active Deploy: Pipeline Integration</a> and <a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/05/05/bluemix-active-deploy-custom-pipeline-support/\">Custom Pipeline Support</a> (blog)</li>\n</ul>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/08/active-deploy-resource-optimized-deployment/","date":"2016-08-09T15:45:58","modified":"2016-12-07T16:28:53","format":"standard","slug":"active-deploy-resource-optimized-deployment","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=39808","excerpt":"<p>This post summarizes how the Active Deploy service can help you easily manage updates to your application without downtime to improve the availability of your application.

In simple terms, a graph database is a database management system where relationships between data points are as important as the data points themselves.</p>\n<p>For example, when you think of your relationships to the many people you have in your life, you do not think of a table of data. You think of the relationships as a graph: individuals have connections to other people. This means that a graph is a more natural way of representing data.</p>\n<h2>What is IBM Graph?</h2>\n<p>IBM Graph is a powerful, enterprise-grade IBM service, that unleashes the power of data connections by letting you store, query, and visualize data points, connections, and properties in a property graph. It enables you to build better applications, such as recommendation and fraud detection engines, without requiring you to manage an on-premises database.</p>\n<p>IBM Graph is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Highly available</i> &#8211; the service is always up and your data is always accessible, so your web and mobile apps are always working hard for your business.</li>\n<li><i>Managed 24/7</i> &#8211; our systems and experts monitor and manage everything in your stack, every day, all day. This frees your dev team to focus on building that next great app, without worrying about the graph.</li>\n<li><i>Seamlessly scalable</i> &#8211; starting small and scaling on demand as your data size and complexity increases, enabling your cutting-edge application to grow with your business.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What can you do using the service?</h2>\n<p>With the IBM Graph service, you can store data as vertices or nodes connected by edges, rather than the more traditional form of storing the data in tabular form using rows and columns. You can also add and store properties in the form of key/value pairs associated with the data, for both vertices and edges.</p>\n<p>The result is a property graph capability, that lets you see more details about data relationships, and see those details more easily. The graph helps you perform increasingly complex analysis, by helping simplify what would otherwise be hard problems and applications.</p>\n<p>You can develop database applications that are deployed in the cloud. This approach helps reduce the cost and complexity barriers for developers. Using the service, your application developers have access to an API that can work on any platform, and be used by any application that can make HTTP requests.</p>\n<p>The result is a developer-friendly service that can be used to create user-friendly applications, for addressing complex analysis problems.</p>\n<h2>More information about IBM Graph and graph databases</h2>\n<p>You can find out more about IBM Graph and graph databases by reading articles on IBM developerWorks, such as <a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/07/15/graph-databases-natural-way-to-represent-data/\" target=\"_blank\">Graph databases &#8211; a natural way to represent data</a>, and <a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/05/09/graph-recommendation-engines/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Bet: Graph Recommendation Engines</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do you get started?</h2>\n<p>IBM Graph service is available in the <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-graph/\" target=\"_blank\">Data and Analytics</a> section of the Bluemix catalog. To start using this service, see the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/cloud-data-services/graph/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Graph</a> welcome page. Documentation specific to IBM Graph is available <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/graphdb/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>New users can provision the service using the &#8216;Standard Plan&#8217;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>500 MB of free data storage.</li>\n<li>25,000 API calls free per month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you exceed those figures for base usage, your account is charged at the following rates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$15.00 (USD) per month, for each additional GB of data storage.</li>\n<li>$0.20 (USD) per month, for each block of 1000 additional API calls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The limits and charges are indicative as at GA.</em></p>\n<h3>Early adopters</h3>\n<p>Existing users currently on the &#8216;beta&#8217; or &#8216;entry&#8217; plan have a &#8216;grace&#8217; period until September 1st, 2016 to upgrade to the &#8216;Standard Plan&#8217;. After that date, the service will no longer support API calls made by users on the &#8216;entry plan&#8217;.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to update to the standard plan: using the dashboard, or using the Cloud Foundry command line.</p>\n<h4>Using the Bluemix dashboard.</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Go into your Bluemix dashboard and click on your IBM Graph service tile, similar to the following example:<br />\n<a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PlanEntry.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39335\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PlanEntry.png\" alt=\"PlanEntry\" width=\"283\" height=\"285\" /></a><br />\n2. On the service dashboard, look for the &#8216;Plan&#8217; link, and click it:<br />\n<a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PlanLink.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-39337\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PlanLink-300x300.png\" alt=\"PlanLink\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\n3. You are presented with options for changing your service plan. Select the Standard plan, then click Save:<br />\n<a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ChoosePlan.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-39340\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ChoosePlan-300x190.png\" alt=\"ChoosePlan\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" /></a></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Using the Cloud Foundry command line</h4>\n<p>If you manage your service using Cloud Foundry command line tools, you might prefer to upgrade your plan that way.<br />\nThe basic command to upgrade your plan is as follows:<br />\n<span class=\"message_body\"><code>cf update-service '&lt;insert service instance name&gt;' -p '&lt;insert new plan name&gt;'<br />\n</code></span>Using the service instance from the earlier dashboard example, the equivalent Cloud Foundry command would be:<br />\n<code>cf update-service 'Upgrade-Demo' -p 'Standard'</code></p>\n<h2>Feedback and getting help</h2>\n<p>We strongly value your feedback. If you have any questions while using the service or if you need help, please ask your questions at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-graph\" target=\"_blank\">#ibm-graph</a> on

Some key features in Amalgam8 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is multi-language. It doesn’t make assumptions what language the service is written in.</li>\n<li>Can be added to your container seamlessly. The developer should not have to make changes within their service. Amalgam8 decouples the service registration, discovery and load-balancing from the application logic.</li>\n<li>It is platform and runtime independent, i.e., it runs on the IBM Container service on Bluemix, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.</li>\n<li>It has a control plane made up of a Registry and Controller. The control plane is shared by all the tenants.</li>\n<li>It has multi-tenant support in that each tenant has its own sidecar.</li>\n<li>It has support for versioning, failure injection, injection of

We&#8217;re pleased to announce that the next step towards this goal is now complete, with the addition of the MQ Light API.</p>\n<p>The MQ Light API is a simple but powerful AMQP-based messaging API for Java, Node.js, Python and Ruby. It allows apps to be written quickly and portably in a unified messaging model that supports both queue and publish/subscribe messaging patterns, enabling scenarios such as worker offload, event notification, and batch processing to be simply written.</p>\n<p>By being part of Message Hub, these apps can now not only enjoy the the cloud scale and throughput capabilities of Message Hub, but also tight integration with other Message Hub apps and easy access to further capabilities as these are added, such as on-premises hybrid integration and bridging to other Bluemix services such as analytics.</p>\n<p>Apps written using this API can not only be run against the Message Hub service, but also against IBM MQ as part of an on-premise enterprise messaging solution.

always looking for ways to enhance our customers&#8217; experience whether it is creating new powerful services or making improvements to the overall Bluemix platform. Our developers have been working hard to develop various new communication functions for our customers.</p>\n<h2>How to opt-in to support email notifications</h2>\n<p>Today, we are pleased to announce new functionality that enables you to be notified through email about any public region (US South, EU-GB, and AU-SYD) incidents and maintenance that affects the Bluemix platform infrastructure. By default, you must opt-in to receive these email notifications.</p>\n<p>To enable these notifications, complete these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into <a href=\"http://www.bluemix.net/\">Bluemix</a>.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Account</b> and select <b>Notifications</b>.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Notifications.jpg\" alt=\"notifications\" /></li>\n<li>Select the <b>Platform</b> tab.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Platform.jpg\" alt=\"platform\" /></li>\n<li>Select the email option for Incidents, Planned maintenance, or both and click <b>Save</b>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The changes will be automatically saved to your profile and will remain in effect until you change them again.<br />\n<i>Notes:</i></p>\n<ul>\n<li>August 2016: If an incident or platform maintenance affects more than one region, you will receive a single, combined email message for all affected regions instead of a separate email message for each affected region.</li>\n<li>This communication system will alert you by email of the initial incident or maintenance notification. Any updates to the incident or maintenance will be available on the <a href=\"http://ibm.biz/bluemixstatus\" target=\"_blank\">Bluemix Status Page</a>.</li>\n<li>This initial release of the communication functionality communicates incident and maintenance information for the Bluemix platform. However, it does not communicate this information for services or buildpacks that run on the platform. We have existing communication methods to alert you to incident, maintenance, security, and announcement notifications for the both the platform and its IBM services.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bluemix Status page and RSS feed</h2>\n<p>In addition to the new email communication functionality, you can periodically view the <a href=\"http://ibm.biz/bluemixstatus\" target=\"_blank\">Bluemix Status Page</a> to see a listing of all of our incident, maintenance, security, and announcement notifications. Maintenance notifications are typically published 24 hours prior to a disruptive change.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can sign up to get an RSS feed of all of these notifications. On our Bluemix Status Page, which was referenced previously, click the RSS icon next to Updates.

Since IBM Blue Box manages OpenStack private clouds on behalf of our customers, we&#8217;ve initiated the upgrade process to Mitaka for customers, bringing them the latest and greatest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MitakaBlog_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Maintenance downtime is costly for any cloud customer—we get it, time is money. As a result, IBM Blue Box has invested heavily in tools, teams, and processes&#8211;plus our experience with hundreds of OpenStack upgrades&#8211;to ensure the in-place upgrade to Mitaka is a non-event for customers. We expect to have the majority of our customer clouds running on Mitaka by the end of July.</p>\n<h2>New features with Mitaka release</h2>\n<p>Mitaka brings a lot of new <a href=\"https://www.blueboxcloud.com/insight/blog-article/forging-ahead-in-the-private-cloud-race\">capabilities</a>; allow me to highlight my top three:</p>\n<h3>Federated Identity</h3>\n<p>IBM Blue Box has been working with the community to realize the vision since we discussed the topic in <a href=\"https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/summit-videos/presentation/federated-identity-demo-deep-dive\">Vancouver</a> last year. So, it’s extremely gratifying to be able to provide production ready Keystone-to-Keystone Federated Identity to our customers. With this new capability, customers can use the same credentials to access their cloud resources across multiple authorized OpenStack clouds. For customers with multiple OpenStack clouds, Keystone-to-Keystone Federated Identity enables administrators to enable single sign on without having to provision additional identities across all their clouds.</p>\n<h3>Heat Autoscaling</h3>\n<p>Modern cloud native applications are API driven, declarative and elastic. Many customers use Heat templates as the framework to deploy and orchestrate cloud native applications. With Heat supporting LBaaS v2 API in Mitaka, customers can deploy cloud native applications that auto-scale resources via Heat templates and autoscaling groups.</p>\n<h3>OpenStack Dashboard and Client</h3>\n<p>While there are DevOps ninjas that never need to use OpenStack Dashboard and Client, mere mortals depend on these tools to get work done. Dashboard adds new capabilities (such as LBaaS support for customers) plus intuitiveness around attaching volumes and networks, while Client aggregates access to all OpenStack services in one seamless interface. This level of fit and finish is necessary to ensure that users get maximum utility from their OpenStack cloud.</p>\n<h2>Two delivery models, one cloud experience</h2>\n<p>As illustrated above, IBM Blue Box offers a single cloud experience across two different delivery models. In order to maintain a consistent experience between IBM Blue Box Local and Dedicated, we have to keep the OpenStack services identical and provide the same set of infrastructure building blocks. Only when there is a common cloud substrate can the top benefits of hybrid cloud (workload portability, elasticity, single sign-on and orchestration) be truly realized.</p>\n<p>To that end, we are now bringing the same capabilities available on Dedicated to Local, namely:</p>\n<h3>Two new compute node choices</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>IO Optimized is a new compute node type meant to support applications with high memory and high speed storage access requirements such as application caches.</li>\n<li>High Storage Capacity provides a significant amount of ephemeral storage to support storage hungry workloads such as logging databases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Additional block storage option</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hybrid Block Storage solution increases storage capacity fourfold while delivering exceptional IOPS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, Local supports POWER Compute Nodes (Habañero) to allow customers to deploy compatible applications.</p>\n<p>IBM Blue Box just celebrated our one-year anniversary of being part of the IBM Cloud family. We feel that the Mitaka release is fitting way to celebrate.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/07/blue-box-cloud-delivers-latest-and-greatest/","date":"2016-07-08T20:00:38","modified":"2016-12-07T16:30:05","format":"standard","slug":"blue-box-cloud-delivers-latest-and-greatest","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=38125","excerpt":"<p>Recently, we finalized our latest release of IBM Blue Box Cloud based on Mitaka, the latest release of OpenStack.

you want to send push notifications to your mobile app users in response to an event? This is now available out of the box with the event-driven compute service OpenWhisk on Bluemix.</p>\n<h2>Getting started with Push Notification and OpenWhisk</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" style=\"width: 40%; max-width: 300px;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/openwhisk_hero_medium.png\" alt=\"\" /> Follow the <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/openwhisk/openwhisk_catalog.html\" target=\"_blank\">instructions</a> under the <i>Using the Push package</i> heading to configure the package.</p>\n<p>The <code>sendMessage action</code> sends notifications to registered devices. It opens up a whole new set of possibilities to send mobile push notifications on various events. For example, send notifications to passengers on flight updates, send transaction receipts to customers upon transaction, or a simple one like notification of a new Slack post using Slack APIs and the Push Notification packages of OpenWhisk together.</p>\n<p>The <code>feed</code> can trigger events upon a device subscription/unsubscription or user subscription/unsubscription. The device subscription/unsubscription could be an important event to trigger alternate actions. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An insurance provider uses mobile notifications as a primary channel for communicating messages to its clients. If a user has uninstalled the app (triggers &#8220;device unregistered&#8221; event) from the mobile, the provider responds by sending a message to the user through alternate channels.</li>\n<li>A retailer runs sales campaign by creating tags and letting interested users subscribe to them; the user subscription could be an important event to send targeted offers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sample Useage</h2>\n<p>To see how the <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/push-notifications/\" target=\"_blank\">Push Notification service</a> works with OpenWhisk, try out our <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-push-notifications/Retail-Customer-Feedback-Scenario\" target=\"_blank\">ibm-bluemix-push-notifications/Retail-Customer-Feedback-Scenario</a> on GitHub. It demonstrates a retail customer feedback scenario together with an ecosystem of services on Bluemix as depicted in the following diagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/flowchart-sample-push-openwhisk.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/flowchart-sample-push-openwhisk.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>In this scenario, a retailer is soliciting feedback on a recent purchase from the customers. Once the customer provides feedback, the feedback is analyzed using Watson Tone Analyzer service and a relevant message is delivered using the Push Notification Service. If the customer is disappointed as assessed by the tone, then the retailer may provide some discount/return proposal.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, feel free to post a comment below or on Stack Overflow with the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/openwhisk\" target=\"_blank\">#openwhisk</a> and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix\" target=\"_blank\">#ibm-bluemix</a> tags.</p>\n<p><i>—Thejaswini Ramachandra</i></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/07/push-notification-service-and-openwhisk/","date":"2016-07-05T01:00:28","modified":"2016-12-07T16:30:08","format":"standard","slug":"push-notification-service-and-openwhisk","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=37763","excerpt":"<p>Do you want to send push notifications to your mobile app users in response to an event?

After the upgrade, the following buildpack versions will be available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">go_buildpack v1.7.5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.6.16\">ruby_buildpack v1.6.16</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases/tag/v4.3.10\">php_buildpack v4.3.10</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.5.5\">python_buildpack v1.5.5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.5.11\">nodejs_buildpack v1.5.11</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/releases/tag/v3.6\">java_buildpack v3.6</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Will my application be affected?</h3>\n<p>Any existing application deployed with any of the updated buildpacks will not be affected unless it is re-deployed. Once re-deployed, some applications might be affected by the changes in the buildpack dependencies, defaults or other runtime-specific changes outlined below. Most applications should re-deploy and continue to work without any additional updates.</p>\n<h3>How can my application be affected?</h3>\n<h4>Cached dependencies</h4>\n<p>Except the <code>java_buildpack</code>, the community buildpacks installed on Bluemix have a cache of the key runtime versions and other dependencies. Typically, the cache contains two <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">patch</a> versions for each runtime&#8217;s major version. For example, the new <code>nodejs_buildpack</code> contains <code>0.12.12</code> and <code>0.12.13</code> versions of the <code>0.12.x</code> runtime and <code>0.10.43</code> and <code>0.10.44</code> versions of the <code>0.10.x</code> runtime.</p>\n<p><i>If an application requests a specific runtime version that&#8217;s not in the cache, the application deployment will fail</i>. Therefore, it is important to check if your application does not rely on a specific dependency that may no longer be in the cache after the buildpack update.</p>\n<p>The best practice of specifying runtime versions for your application is to only specify the major version if possible. For example, in case of Node.js applications specify node version as <code>0.12.x</code> in your <code>package.json</code> file instead of the full version such as <code>0.12.11</code>. That way your application will be much less susceptible to the cached runtime version changes with each buildpack update. This will also make it easier for your application to stay atop of latest runtime security updates or bug fixes.</p>\n<h4>Buildpack defaults</h4>\n<p>The buildpacks will usually use a default version of the runtime or other key component if an application does not explicitly set it.</p>\n<p><i>The defaults may change between buildpack versions</i>. Therefore, it is also important to check if your application is relying on these defaults, as they may affect your application.</p>\n<p>The best practice is to always specify your application dependencies explicitly.</p>\n<h3>What are the key changes?</h3>\n<p>You can find what runtime versions are supported and all other details on each buildpack&#8217;s release page (see the links above). Below is a short list of the key changes in the new buildpack versions that may affect your application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>go_buildpack</b> – the <i>godep</i> version was updated to <code>v62</code>.

This revival signals that the manufacturers believe this product category is on solid ground, and while in the scope of IoT, consumer electronics might be considered a niche segment, we believe significant growth is happening now, and agree with the forecast that by 2020 there will be close to 500,000,000 connected smart appliances in homes across the globe.</p>\n<p>Several technologies have converged which are fueling this growth – advances in big data and analytics, cheap access to cloud computing, ubiquitous wireless connectivity and thanks to Moore’s law, a drop in the per unit price for sensors and computational capabilities, those required to deliver that Smart Oven you’ve read about or seen at your last trip to the electronics store.</p>\n<h2>Bringing connected appliance products to market</h2>\n<p>This convergence has made the price point to embed IoT capabilities into household appliances drop to levels where large scale planning and deployments can commence. We’ve seen this with our partner Whirlpool, who is leveraging Watson IoT as the technology backbone for it’s connected appliances.</p>\n<p>Due to all of this, I’m proud to say we’ve released IoT for Electronics to the market, an offering to help our clients and partners bring connected appliances to market with global scale, bullet proof security and features required to deliver a connected appliance product to market.</p>\n<p>There are numerous justifications to embark on a connected appliance project with Watson IoT. But in our view chief among those are to begin to develop a relationship with your customers, the end users who you’ve never known. Because of this the core service IoT for Electronics delivers with our first release with be the ability for an end user to “claim” their device. While a connected oven could be instrumented and the manufacturer could make use of the operational data streaming from that oven, by gaining a view into who the end user is, and giving them a channel to connect with the manufacturer directly, we believe IoT for Electronics is the first step towards enabling the end user of that oven to start developing a relationship with the brand. That in our view is transformative.</p>\n<p>Knowing who your customer is and ensuring their user profile is paired with the appliance ID and profile, we’re able to now segment our customers in new and innovative ways. We understand why they use the appliances in the way they do – a single 20 something in Manhattan will use the oven much different than a 40 something with kids in Brooklyn. By gathering and segmenting demographic information and using that data to enrich the operational data coming from the oven, additional insights can be spotted, and a more contextual relationship can be formed. This is why we’ve focused on device claiming and mobile integration with the IoT Platform as the first features we’ve delivered with the IoT for Electronics offering.</p>\n<h2>Get connected with &#8220;IoT for Electronics Starter&#8221; app</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" style=\"width: 40%; max-width: 250px;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/iot_electronic_starter.png\" alt=\"\" /> Along with claiming, we’re also providing an integrated, end to end sample app to guide the user through the process of connecting devices, causing device failures and integration into our Watson IoT Platform so you can see how the connected appliances impact the platform service.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to visit our <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/iot-for-electronics-starter/\" target=\"_blank\">IoT for Electronics starter app on Bluemix</a> and get moving on your connected appliance pilot, POC or project.</p>\n<p>Feedback?

for the automotive industry to enable the development of cognitive IoT solutions in areas such as advanced mobility, in-vehicle services, automated and autonomous driving, and commercializing vehicle data: IBM IoT for Automotive.</p>\n<h2>Overview of the IBM IoT for Automotive service</h2>\n<p>We appreciate your feedback on this service as we continue to enhance and improve the IoT for Automotive product on the Bluemix platform. The developer community is always critical to helping us understand your challenges and to continuously improve our offerings. The following is a brief introduction to the <a href=\"http://ibm.biz/iot-for-automotive\" target=\"_blank\">IoT for Automotive service</a>.</p>\n<h3>Management of vehicle data</h3>\n<p>Support is included for many of the most common automotive data standards from ISO and ETSI for data encoding/decoding, transformations, and data models. IoT for Automotive supports common industry message formats including MQTT, HTTPS, and UDP, so you can easily integrate existing vehicle data streams into the service for a range of streaming and big data analytics. Data is stored within the Bluemix service where it can be queried. Furthermore, external data stores can also be used through provided interfaces, such as the Cloudant database service.</p>\n<h3>Near real-time analytics</h3>\n<p>Situational detection for vehicles, drivers, and environmental objects is available as they occur, to enable vehicle-to-everything (V2X) solutions such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) via the cloud. A rule-based approach provides the flexibility to capture any number of live events based on the vehicle or environmental data that is sent to the service. This means that simple rules can be triggered based on a single vehicle, such as leaving a geo-fenced area, or when a vehicle moves outside a geo-fenced area but with its anti-theft system engaged.</p>\n<p>Complex rules can be easily created, such as the detection of multiple vehicles engaging ABS in a specific location in a short period of time. You can also develop new applications using included automotive analytics application APIs.</p>\n<h3>Context for your location-based applications</h3>\n<p>Using IBM patented high-performance algorithms, several new capabilities are available through REST API calls to develop contextual map based applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highly accurate map matching is a foundational capability to locate the geospatial data to the road network geometry;</li>\n<li>Events created by the near real-time situational rules, in-house, or external data sources, such as traffic, temporary road closures, or changes to speed limits can be injected into the real time map layers;</li>\n<li>Develop applications such as live traffic sign maps, or to create navigation that updates based on live information from roadside infrastructure and other vehicles based on these events.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Driver Behavior – identify risky behavior and help improve efficiency</h3>\n<p>Driver Behavior provides an understanding of the individual driving patterns of a vehicle operator to identify risky behaviour, and violation of policies. The service can also help to improve driving style and subsequently improve the fuel efficiency of gas or electric vehicles. The service employs real-time computation on the location data stream of a connected vehicle, offering the following range of capabilities through REST API calls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed related information, such as accelerating too quickly, or braking too hard when frequent stops occur;</li>\n<li>Style related information, such as turning too sharply, accelerating into a turn, or breaking on the way out of a turn;</li>\n<li>Identification of tired driving behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The moving object map analytics capabilities of IoT for Automotive enable a variety of applications to be built through these APIs on different types of vehicles. These applications include navigational assistance, contextualizing roads, and weather incidents. In addition, these services can understand vehicle usage patterns across a cross-section of vehicle owners and fleet operations. The services can also help to rate drivers for insurance risks. Finally, drivers are 10 times more likely to get into an accident if they’re distracted, emotional, or upset, all of which could be detected through driving anomalies enabling the vehicle to alert the driver to ensure greater safety.</p>\n<h2>We want your feedback!</h2>\n<p>We appreciate the feedback that we’ve already received and we look for more suggestions to help continue to build these capabilities. Feel free to add your comments below or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IBMBluemix\" target=\"_blank\">@IBMBluemix</a>. The new service, <a href=\"http://ibm.biz/iot-for-automotive\" target=\"_blank\">IoT for Automotive</a>, is published in the Bluemix Labs Catalog under the <i>Internet of Things</i> category.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/06/new-iot-for-automotive-service/","date":"2016-06-23T10:00:30","modified":"2016-12-07T16:30:34","format":"standard","slug":"new-iot-for-automotive-service","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=37051","excerpt":"<p>IBM

By making these capabilities available as Bluemix services clients can easily experiment, build, and deploy innovative cognitive solutions in Bluemix.

As a public web service, it’s the largest host of source code in the world, with more than 15 million users and more than 34 million repositories. If you’re an organization with more stringent security needs, <a href=\"https://enterprise.github.com/home\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Enterprise</a> (GHE) is the on-premises version of GitHub, and it’s the most popular collaborative social coding platform for organizations who need to maintain complete control over their source code repositories and projects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/integrations-graphic-github.png\" alt=\"GitHub flow\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to running GitHub Enterprise, you have two options today. You can either bring it in-house and host it behind your firewall, or you can choose to run it as an instance hosted on cloud like Azure or AWS. Regardless of the option you choose, you are responsible for planning and provisioning the required infrastructure, acquiring the expertise and allocating the budget needed to manage the platform.</p>\n<p>These requirements can add a burden to your IT staff as they must configure and maintain your security policies, ensure availability, provide backups, and maintain required integrations with third-party and open source tools critical to your end-to-end DevOps lifecycle.</p>\n<h2>Free your IT staff – GitHub Enterprise on Bluemix!</h2>\n<p>That’s why IBM is announcing today the first and only fully managed, cloud-hosted version of GHE. As you may recall, earlier this year, IBM and GitHub signed a <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2016/02/22/github-enterprise-service/\" target=\"_blank\">strategic agreement</a> to enable development teams to deliver the next generation of cloud applications at higher velocities across secure private and hybrid environments without having to worry about the overhead of running infrastructure.</p>\n<div class=\"ibm-pull-quote ibm-h2 ibm-inset\">\n<blockquote><p><em><span class=\"ibm-pullquote-open\">“</span>Developers love GitHub&#8230; but managing the infrastructure can be resource intensive.</em></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Today, that partnership bears its first fruit with GitHub Enterprise running on <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/dedicated/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Bluemix Dedicated</a>. As an enterprise developer, you can now learn, code and work with GitHub’s collaborative development tools inside your own dedicated, hosted environment with robust security capabilities, managed for your organization. With GitHub Enterprise running on IBM Bluemix Dedicated, you never have to worry about the overhead costs of building and managing infrastructure – it’s all taken care of for you.</p>\n<h2>First-of-its-kind Managed Service</h2>\n<p>GitHub Enterprise on Bluemix Dedicated is a first-of-its-kind cloud-hosted service, which means all the following activities are managed by IBM, freeing your resources for more critical tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provisioning the infrastructure, and configuring it to seamlessly connect to your network (user authentication, etc.); with scaling provided as needed.</li>\n<li>Setting up GHE with a fail over server, and monitoring its use. Switching to the fail over server in case of any issues, significantly reducing GHE down-time.</li>\n<li>Administrating GHE, applying upgrades and patches as needed.</li>\n<li>Logging GHE activities and performing back-ups.</li>\n<li>Providing 24&#215;7 support for the GHE installation.</li>\n<li>Providing a Service Level Agreement for GHE availability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these activities typically require skills and resources that many organizations don’t want to acquire and allocate, since they are not core to their business. What’s more, if you have repositories or code on existing GitHub.com or other repositories, you can easily migrate to GitHub Enterprise on Bluemix Dedicated.

This typically includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>redundant data</li>\n<li>out-of-date data</li>\n<li>duplicate data</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What makes Reappt data efficient?</h2>\n<p>A core component of Reappt is the way it manages data. Every single update (message) is analyzed, and only the binary delta from one message to the next is sent. We call this <em>delta streaming</em>. This data efficiency means that most development teams see savings in bandwidth of up to 90% compared with other products.</p>\n<h2>New JSON delta streaming feature</h2>\n<p>As developers, we need to stop paying to move data around when we don’t need to. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) may offer much-improved data efficiency over its predecessors (such as XML), but the attribute markup still represents significant overhead on the wire.</p>\n<p>Now, for a given JSON object, Reappt’s delta streaming feature provides clients only the differences between old and new data, rather than providing the entire JSON payload; this limits the need to send markup that isn’t changing from one message to the next.</p>\n<h2>An example using JSON</h2>\n<p>The table below shows two example JSON messages, where the value of the “title” attribute is updated. The delta between each message is highlighted in red. We show the binary equivalent and message size, as this is how the data is transmitted over the wire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Image-Bluemix-Blog.png\" alt=\"A Reappt delta streaming example using JSON\" /></p>\n<p>The binary delta between message 1 and message 2 represents just 16 bytes. The remainder of the payload is redundant and does not need to be sent.</p>\n<p>By sending only the delta information, we are saving 63 bytes in this simple example &#8211; an 80% data efficiency improvement over other real-time messaging vendors that send the full message each time.</p>\n<h2>Reduce your data costs</h2>\n<p>Calculating and sending differences between data objects for efficiency is common for file transfer protocols, but this approach for real-time messaging is unique to <a href=\"http://www.pushtechnology.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Push Technology</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reappt.io\" target=\"_blank\">Reappt</a>. Our confidence in this market-leading position is reinforced by moving away from the standard message-based pricing model. Developers are often forced to design their apps to fit messaging limits in order to reduce costs. Reappt now offers unlimited messages on all service tiers charging instead for the amount of data sent between endpoints.</p>\n<p>Start making your apps more data efficient today using <a href=\"http://www.reappt.io\" target=\"_blank\">Reappt</a> and reduce data costs on IBM Bluemix.

class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/swift_announcement_hero.png\" alt=\"\" /> Greetings from WWDC—where the Swift@IBM team is talking about Swift on the server.</p>\n<p>Having delivered mobile apps in Swift since the language was released, we knew its power and were excited to begin work last December on extending its value to the cloud.</p>\n<p>First, within the Swift.org community, we needed to do some preliminary work on <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2016/02/22/talking-about-swift-concurrency-on-linux/\">multi-threading and concurrency</a> as part of the Foundation and libdispatch projects.</p>\n<p>And we needed to build some tools to take the next steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kitura</strong>: Keeping pace with latest Swift language support on the way to the release of 3.0, and leveraging the newly-announced Swift Package Manager, this web framework bridges the development experience across mobile and server platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Packages</strong>: A host of new packages cover, among other things, sockets (BlueSocket), security (BlueCryptor), networking (Kitura-net), cross-platform system support (Kitura-sys), data storage (Kitura-CouchDB, Kitura-redis, Kitura-session-redis), samples (BluePic, Todolist, Starter).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We decided to share these since community attention improves the overall effort of bringing Swift to the server. And so far the response has been tremendous.</p>\n<p>Frankly, I don&#8217;t think we could have predicted how much fun we&#8217;d have. We&#8217;ve all heard it: this modern language is easy to learn and more and more developers are learning it. Some are trying Swift for the first time in the IBM Swift Sandbox. And with over 1.5 million code runs by developers across 133 countries who use the Sandbox regularly, both to learn Swift and share code, we see something magical happening.</p>\n<p>To further raise the stakes on experimentation, developers have asked us to integrate the enabling technologies with one another and with the sandbox.</p>\n<p>Our Swift Runtime for IBM Bluemix, providing all the latest Swift technology to support Kitura-based applications, advances support for innovating web services in Swift. Written in Swift, Kitura is arguably the most current web framework since it includes the many Swift.org code updates coming from the community&#8217;s relentless innovations, which we love.</p>\n<p>The IBM Swift Package Catalog, with over 1500 Client and server side packages for Swift developers, now is enabled to <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2016/06/13/try-out-swift-packages-in-the-ibm-swift-sandbox/\">launch sample packages in the Sandbox</a>.</p>\n<p>We owe you!</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s the next batch of tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Check out the new IBM Cloud Tools for Swift.</strong> With an easy to use visual interface, this is the app for developers who are most productive in the Xcode environment and want complementary deployment and management capabilities in a local environment. As with all of our tools, we are working to meet each Swift developer where you work best. We want this tool to extend our own proven productivity with Xcode by helping us with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code generation and provisioning to pre-tested Kitura runtimes</li>\n<li>Unified management of credentials</li>\n<li>Centralized control and monitoring of assets deployed on the cloud</li>\n<li>Local notifications of remote actions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are starting with a beta but I think some of you will be glad we didn&#8217;t wait. Check out this blog on <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2016/06/13/ibm-cloud-tools-for-swift/\">how to get started</a>, then <a href=\"http://cloudtools.bluemix.net/\">download the app</a> and let us know what you think.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got something new for Linux developers too.</p>\n<p><strong>Developers are now able to use Swift on LinuxONE™.</strong> This is today&#8217;s most powerful Linux platform for data-serving and systems of record. The safety, speed and expressiveness of Swift are now available on Linux with unmatched performance and scale. Having Swift on LinuxONE™ allows developers to do fit-for-purpose placement of workloads that need access to data in a high-performing, secure, reliable and scalable environment. In addition, we&#8217;ve contributed some code back to Swift.org to enable ongoing collaboration across the community. Here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.enterpriselinuxinsights.com/swift-programming-language-for-ibm-linuxone/\">more info about Swift on LinuxOne</a> if you are interested in understanding the benefits in more detail.</p>\n<p>The IBM Swift Sandbox now includes a Swift on LinuxONE™ beta driver. Try it out.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the new features in our existing lineup as much as the new Mac App and LinuxOne support. All updates and additions are the latest demonstration of a commitment among Swift engineers at IBM to bring Swift to the server with the purpose of radically simplifying end-to-end app development.</p>\n<p>We invite you to join us on the Swift@IBM devCenter as we add features and functions sprint by sprint.</p>\n<p>You can find the latest blogs and tutorials on our Swift@IBM devCenter and we hope you&#8217;ll join us at WWDC (Session: Going Server-side with swift Open Source, Friday, June 17, 9:00-9:50am PDT) where we join Apple to talk about Swift on the Server and what we&#8217;ve learned about where Swift developers want to go next.</p>\n<p>Your ideas and feedback are great&#8211;so please keep them coming.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/patjohn1.jpg\" alt=\"Outside WWDC 2016\" /></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/06/swift-on-the-server-live-at-wwdc-2016/","date":"2016-06-13T12:59:44","modified":"2016-12-07T16:23:02","format":"standard","slug":"swift-on-the-server-live-at-wwdc-2016","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=36762","excerpt":"<p>Greetings from WWDC—where the Swift@IBM team is talking about Swift on the server.

class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/container_icon_hero.png\" alt=\"\" /> We are pleased to announce that the Auto-scaling for Containers capability is now available as beta in the Dallas and London regions. This feature allows users to dynamically scale container groups as part of the IBM Containers service.</p>\n<p>Auto-scaling empowers businesses to assure clients with a fluid experience and cost optimization. Whether you are a retail company requiring five times more resources on Black Friday or two times less on a lazy Sunday afternoon, auto-scaling strikes the right balance so your business is not over spending on unnecessary resources but has just enough to meet your clients’ demands.</p>\n<p>With the new Auto-scaling feature, workloads that are deployed as part of the IBM Container service can support the following business goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure availability for your mission critical applications</li>\n<li>Enable clients to experience your application at any time, regardless of high or low demand times</li>\n<li>Enable client transactions to be completed quickly</li>\n<li>Optimize costs, ensuring you only pay for what is necessary to meet your client demands</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>IBM Container Auto-Scaling &#8211; A Closer Look</strong></h2>\n<p>The Auto-scaling beta for IBM Containers allows you to define scaling policies for your container groups. You can scale up and scale down container instances based on CPU and Memory usage, ensuring you have enough containers deployed during peak demand times and can scale down in response to low demand.</p>\n<p>To enable dynamic scaling, the following key steps are recommended:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review and update the minimum and maximum instances required for the container group</li>\n<li>Define a auto-scaling policy</li>\n<li>Attach/enable the scaling policy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Review and Update Minimum and Maximum instances for a container group</strong><br />\nTo review and update the minimum and maximum instances of the container group, navigate to the <strong>Auto-Scaling</strong> tab of your container group. Under <strong>Group Instances</strong>, update the <strong>Minimum</strong> and <strong>Maximum </strong>number of instances in your group. Any scaling policy that you create and attach will never be able to exceed the upper or lower bounds of the threshold set.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a container group with a minimum of 1 instance and a maximum of 10.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MinMaxPage.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-41531\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MinMaxPage-1024x503.png\" alt=\"MinMaxPage\" width=\"980\" height=\"481\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Define an auto-scaling policy</strong><br />\nTo enable dynamic scaling, define an auto-scaling policy with the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether CPU or memory usage trigger a scaling event</li>\n<li>A rule definition to specify when scaling is triggered, based on thresholds, duration, and cool down periods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example auto-scaling policy is shown below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PolicySnapshot.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-41534\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PolicySnapshot-1024x743.png\" alt=\"PolicySnapshot\" width=\"980\" height=\"711\" /></a></p>\n<p>The above image shows an auto-scale policy named <em>MyCriticaAppAutoscalePolicy</em>. In this policy, a CPU rule is defined to scale-up container instances when the average CPU utilization of the container group is greater than 70% for a duration of 5 mins. Likewise, the rule also scales down instances by a decrement of 1 when the average is less than 30% for a duration of 5 mins.</p>\n<p><strong>Attaching or enabling an auto-scale policy for a container group</strong><br />\nOnce you have defined an auto-scale policy, it must be enabled by attaching it to the container group. To apply your policy to your container group by selecting <strong>Attach </strong>from the <strong>Actions</strong> drop-down menu as the example shows below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-09-05-at-2.01.44-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-41538\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-09-05-at-2.01.44-PM-1024x483.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-09-05 at 2.01.44 PM\" width=\"980\" height=\"462\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once attached, you can see the attachment status of your auto-scale policy by navigating back to the <strong>Auto-Scaling Policies</strong> tab as the following example shows:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-09-05-at-2.07.25-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-41542\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-09-05-at-2.07.25-PM-1024x516.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-09-05 at 2.07.25 PM\" width=\"980\" height=\"494\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Learn More and How to Get Started</h2>\n<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s quite easy to define and enable an auto-scale policy for a container group.

Thank you for all your great feedback, and please keep it coming.</p>\n<h2>A quick introduction to Vulnerability Advisor</h2>\n<p>This post presents a quick tour of VA, its key current capabilities, and some basic examples of how we make use of VA and its key features. VA is available in all geographies supported by Bluemix. We use Bluemix London and Dallas for the examples here. However, your experience should be the same regardless of geography.  You can look at the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/canturkisci/20160221-va-interconnectpub\" target=\"_blank\">VA for your images</a> presentation from InterConnect 2016 for more information.</p>\n<h3>VA image status in Bluemix</h3>\n<p>We start our introduction by logging into <a href=\"https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net\" target=\"_blank\">Bluemix</a>. We use the Bluemix service in London and the classic Bluemix interface for this demo. In a future post, we will show the same steps with the shiny new Bluemix interface. If you have a Bluemix account, log in. If not, sign up for your free trial to get started.</p>\n<p>Once you are logged into Bluemix, click <strong>Catalog</strong>. This is where you first meet with VA. In the catalog, find the Container Images section. Here, you see several IBM provided default images. If you have also pushed images to the Container Service Registry, you see those images here as well. Now, hover your mouse over the images: An information window opens showing the deployment status of the images, which is basically a call to VA under the covers to get the current status of an image.</p>\n<p>The status can be one of three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safe to Deploy</li>\n<li>Deploy with Caution</li>\n<li>Deployment Blocked</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Go to Create View</h3>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s actually try to deploy these containers by creating container instances from these images and see what happens. Just to make things interesting, we try the one that has the Deployment Blocked status. Clicking on the image gets us to the deployment view. Here, there is more information about this image. Note that the CREATE button is disabled (in other words, deployment is blocked). There are three options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View the vulnerability report for this image</li>\n<li>Manage your org&#8217;s policies</li>\n<li>Authorize an override for this deployment<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CreateBlocked.png\" alt=\"Create Blocked\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first option in the deployment view is available to everyone, which tells the vulnerability and policy violation status of the image. The second and third options are available to org managers only, so they can relax and tighten policies for their images based on their requirements.</p>\n<h3>Explore status details</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore each of these options, in the order they are given. First, VA tells you all the discovered vulnerabilities and policy issues about your image. You can also go to related security notices to understand root causes and mitigation actions.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/VA_VulnReport.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/VA_ComplReport.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Browse Policy Manager</h3>\n<p>Second, your org policies give you the ability to see and possibly manage your policies in a view we call Policy Manager. Next to this view, there is also the Deployment Impact view, which tells how your existing images are impacted by the selected policies. <strong>Only org managers can alter policies</strong>. In our current settings, there is only one image that is blocked, while several are in the Deploy with Caution state.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PM_ImpactSidecar.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Change org policies and observe impact</h3>\n<p>Now, for some more fun, let&#8217;s also see if we can change our policies and see their impact. For this, let&#8217;s take a restricted view against vulnerabilities and block images with vulnerabilities from deployment. Once we save it, the impact sidecar gets busy recomputing everything, and now we have several more images in blocked state.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PM_ChangePolicy.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Override policies</h3>\n<p>Third, let&#8217;s look at what happens when we try the override option. In this case, we have a one-time, temporary override to deploy the image. Once we click it, the view for the image changes to Deploy with Caution and the CREATE button is now active. We can happily create our &#8220;risky&#8221; container from this image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Create_Override.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Still, let&#8217;s stop here and not deploy it, because VA told us our container has weak passwords and remote, password-based access enabled. Let&#8217;s hold on for a bit to understand why this is the case and try to fix our image.</p>\n<h3>Discover images with weak passwords</h3>\n<p>Going back to our initial Policy Manager results above (Step 5), the only policy that resulted in a deployment block was &#8220;<i>Image has remote logins enabled, and some users have easily guessed passwords</i>&#8221; and yuji-fff was the only image blocked with this policy. To validate yuji-fff image violates this policy, so we can revisit Step 4 where we explored status details for vulnerabilities and audit violations. The second tab clearly validates our expectation in the last reported violation: &#8220;<i>Password should be strong.</i>&#8221;</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/VA_ComplReport_Pwd.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Update images in local development environment to address policy violation</h3>\n<p>Now that we have identified our offending image and the root cause of its violation, the next natural question is &#8220;How can we fix it?&#8221; For this part, we go back to our local Docker development environment, and improve our image security. There are multiple actions that we can take for this goal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Definitely) provide a strong password</li>\n<li>Disable password based remote authentication</li>\n<li>Disable remote access altogether</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For our image, we have simply rebuilt the image and provided a stronger password with chpasswd as one of the build steps. Then, we pushed the new image to the Bluemix Registry again, which under the covers, triggers a new VA scan. The results of this new scan:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/VA_ComplReport_PwdFixed.png\" alt=\"VA_ComplReport_PwdFixed\" /></p>\n<p>As we see in the scan results, the number of violations went down from 6 to 5. The weak password violation is fixed, and we can now deploy our container without an easily compromisable password.</p>\n<h2>Feedback welcome!</h2>\n<p>This ends our quick introduction to VA with some of its core functions and use cases. We addressed only one of our image violations. However, a better strategy is to address all of the three actions mentioned above, as well as the remaining vulnerability violations. I hope this serves as a useful starter to understanding and leveraging VA capabilities in Bluemix. We are currently working on making this analysis by VA more comprehensive, actionable, and easier to consume. Stay tuned for some of our upcoming new features and send us your feedback with any questions, comments, concerns, and requests for new capabilities.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/06/docker-container-security-with-vulnerability-advisor/","date":"2016-06-10T01:00:58","modified":"2016-12-07T16:30:41","format":"standard","slug":"docker-container-security-with-vulnerability-advisor","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=36391","excerpt":"<p>We introduced the Vulnerability Advisor (VA) service for IBM® Bluemix Containers around DockerCon 2015, and this first version of our service has been running in production since then, continuously scanning thousands of images and reporting to our users on vulnerability and compliance issues.

Teams are gaining speed and agility to deliver updates and iterate fast. In such an environment, maintaining a high level of code quality is paramount. With IBM Deployment Risk Analytics, you can maintain and improve the quality of your code in IBM Bluemix by monitoring your deployments and identifying risks before they are released.</p>\n<p>Deployment Risk Analytics collects and analyzes the results from your testing tools to determine whether your code meets predefined criteria at specified gates in your deployment process. If your code does not meet or exceed the criteria, the deployment is halted, preventing risks from being released. You can use Deployment Risk Analytics as a safety net for your continuous delivery environment or as a way to implement and improve quality standards over time.</p>\n<h2>What you can do with Deployment Risk Analytics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Collect and analyze the results from your unit testing tools, functional testing tools, and code coverage tools to develop a historical perspective of your testing effectiveness. Deployment Risk Analytics supports many of the most popular tools, including Mocha, Karma/Mocha, JUnit, Istanbul, and Blanket.js.</li>\n<li>Make decisions fast based on criteria that your team defines. You can place quality gates between environments in your deployment process to check the quality of your code and ensure that it always meets your standards.</li>\n<li>Create and manage all of the criteria that are used within your Bluemix organization.</li>\n<li>Seamlessly integrate with the Delivery Pipeline and toolchains. When you integrate Deployment Risk Analytics with the Delivery Pipeline, you can manage deployments and quality checks within one tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try it today</h2>\n<p>Deployment Risk Analytics is available on Bluemix. You can find it in the Experimental section, in the DevOps subsection. Deployment Risk Analytics is an experimental service, so it might change over the coming months.

This solved the problem of how to find available instances of a microservice by an application, but some users prefer a web-based interface over the command line. We&#8217;re please to announce that now you can also use Service Discovery to monitor through the Bluemix UI. With this new dashboard, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the status of your instances,</li>\n<li>Check the properties associated to each instance,</li>\n<li>Obtain system information about each instance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t wait! Check out the new Service Discovery Dashboard in Bluemix to easily monitor your microservices.</p>\n<h2>How to get to the new Service Discovery Dashboard?</h2>\n<p>Provision an instance of Service Discovery in the space where you want to register microservices instances. To try out IBM Service Discovery, go to <a href=\"https://new-console.eu-gb.bluemix.net/catalog/services/service-discovery/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Service Discovery Beta in the Bluemix Catalog</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/service_discovery_signup.png\" alt=\"Service Discovery wizard to provision an instance\" /></p>\n<p>After you click <i>Create</i>, the new Service Discovery Dashboard opens.</p>\n<h2>What information is displayed?</h2>\n<p>In the dashboard, each entry represents a unique instance that is internally identified by the ID field. The service name and the endpoint are used to uniquely identify an instance in the Service Discovery registry.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sd-ui.png\" alt=\"Service Discovery Dashboard that shows multiple instances\" /></p>\n<p>For each <a href=\"https://new-console.eu-gb.bluemix.net/docs/services/ServiceDiscovery/svc_discovery_about.html#svc_discovery_ov_inst_parms\" target=\"_blank\">instance</a> that is registered in the Service Discovery registry, you can view the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The total number of instances that are registered in the Service Discovery Registry. Notice that in the Beta the maximum number of instances is 50 per space.</li>\n<li>The status of each instance (Status). The following states are allowed:\n<ul>\n<li>UP: This status indicates that the instance is ready to be used.</li>\n<li>STARTING: This status indicates that the instance is still in the process of being brought online and is not yet available.</li>\n<li>OUT_OF_SERVICE: This status indicates that the instance is registered, but is not available. For example, you can use this status to temporarily remove a service instance for maintenance operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> Note:</strong> Any microservice instance that is registered in the Service Discovery registry, regardless of its status, is counted in the quota of 50 maximum registered instances per space.</li>\n<li>The name of the service (Service).</li>\n<li>The network information of the instance (Endpoint).</li>\n<li>The ID of the instance in Bluemix.</li>\n<li>The TTL (Time to Live) that informs about the time, in seconds, before the instance must renew its registration in the Service Discovery registry.</li>\n<li>Any tags (Tags) that are associated to an instance.<br />\n<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sd-tags.png\" alt=\"Service Discovery Dashboard that multiple instances and the tag values for one of the instances\" /></li>\n<li>Any metadata (Metadata) that is associated to an instance to add extra information.<br />\n<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sd-metadata.png\" alt=\"Service Discovery Dashboard that multiple instances and the metadata values for one of the instances\" /></li>\n<li>The last heartbeat (Last heartbeat) that informs about the last time that the instance renewed its registration in the Service Discovery registry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How can you use the Service Discovery Dashboard?</h2>\n<p>You can use the dashboard to check how many instances are registered in a space and how many available entries you have in the Service Discovery registry. For example, in the following figure, you have no instances registered:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sd-registered.png\" alt=\"Number of registered images\" /></p>\n<p>You can search by Service to view the list of instances that are registered for that service. For example, you can have instances with different tags associated to it or different TTLs. When you search by service name, you can quickly identify differences between the different instances offered for a microservice.</p>\n<p>You can search by status to identify the availability of a service. For example, to find out instances that are OUT_OF_SERVICE, you can use the information that is associated to each instance that is listed and investigate the reasons why it is not available.</p>\n<p>You can filter the list of services and registered instances by any of the fields associated for each instance in the dashboard. For example, you can search by service name and status UP to find out how many instances are available to handle requests for a service.</p>\n<p>You can use the dashboard to find out which microservices are having issues rather than letting the microservices disappear from the registry. For example, you can add logic into your microservices where if a dependency on another service is unavailable, the microservice re-registers itself as <i>out of service</i> until that dependency is back online again.</p>\n<h2>We welcome your feedback!</h2>\n<p>Check it out and let us know what you think and what other improvements you’d like to see in the

They’ve now reached a million developers in their community with 75 billion annual API requests. That translates into a global reach that is creating 1 billion devices.

That proclamation was followed up with a big-time announcement: <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49809.wss\" target=\"_blank\">Watson services will now be available on the new Twilio Marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/marketplace/add-ons/ibm-watson-sentiment\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Watson Message Sentiment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/marketplace/add-ons/ibm-watson-insights\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Watson Message Insights</a> are now available as what Twilio calls &#8220;Add-Ons&#8221; in their new <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/marketplace/add-ons\" target=\"_blank\">Marketplace</a>.

The Watson Speech to Text Add-on, as part of the Recording Add-on category, is up next for Twilio developers.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, it’s a very smart move by Twilio. Watson continues to be one of the hottest brands in the IT industry. And services that explore sentiment and insights are where Watson is strongest. Think of it as an evolution of our partnership. Of course, Bluemix will continue to be the platform of choice for all of Watson’s services, but we must share the collective intelligence (there’s that term again) to grow our partner

Tone Analyzer API Goes GA with Improved Models","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":431,"username":"alehr@us.ibm.com","name":"Alisha Lehr","first_name":"Alisha","last_name":"Lehr","nickname":"alehr@us.ibm.com","slug":"alehrus-ibm-com","URL":"","avatar":"","description":"","registered":"2016-09-22T14:36:33+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/431","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/431/posts"}}},"content":"<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToneAnalyzerUpdated.png\" alt=\"\" /> Since Watson Tone Analyzer went beta earlier this year, our team has been busy working with sponsor users to validate and improve the service. We’ve had a lot of great feedback, and we’re excited to launch a Generally Available (GA) version of Watson Tone Analyzer that includes service improvements to enable tone detection in a broader variety of communications.</p>\n<h2>Improved tone detection models</h2>\n<p>The new GA service has improved textual tone detection models across the categories of Emotion, Language and Social. Specifically, the GA version of Watson Tone Analyzer has expanded context sensitivity. This updated service goes beyond using lexical tokens to interpret tones. We have incorporated additional features such as punctuations, emoticons, and language parameters. As a result, the service is able to provide more robust tone insight.</p>\n<p>Our emotion detection models have been trained on an even larger dataset to include more features like emoticons and slang words. Many of our sponsor users were using Tone Analyzer on social media posts and it was key that our emotion models could recognize tones in the style of communication commonly used in social media.</p>\n<p>In addition, our models have been improved to handle negation. If there is negation in a sentence, Tone Analyzer picks up on this signal when interpreting the tones present in the communication:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/document-tone-summary.png\" alt=\"Example Document Tone Summary\" /></p>\n<p>This improvement has helped to drive the accuracy of our tone outputs at both the sentence and document level.</p>\n<h2>Watson Tone Analyzer: transforming the customer care space</h2>\n<p>We’ve seen many creative applications of Watson Tone Analyzer, ranging from Connectidy using it in <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2016/05/connectidy-transforming-dating-industry-tone-analyzer/\">relationship science</a> to fashion house Marchesa integrating the technology into their <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2016/04/29/watson-and-marchesa/\">‘cognitive dress.’ </a> One area that we see Tone Analyzer unlocking a significant amount of value is in the Customer Care Space. Tone detection can considerably enhance our understanding of users’ emotional or social states. Understanding a user’s tone can be pivotal in improving user interactions. Below we’ve highlighted two innovative examples:</p>\n<h3>Removing the ‘Tone Deafness’ in Digital Agents</h3>\n<p>As it becomes more common for humans to interact with machine conversational agents, it becomes even more important to ensure that these interactions don’t loose that ‘human touch.’ <a href=\"http://www.nextit.com/\">Next IT</a> is addressing this challenge with its intelligent, conversational interfaces and Watson Tone Analyzer. Next IT is focused on developing tools and methods to improve machine conversational agents, and is using Tone Analyzer to enhance the interactions by better understanding user’s feelings and needs:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Next-IT-Conversational-Interface11.jpg\" alt=\"Next IT Conversational Interface\" /></p>\n<p>The insight from tone analyzer is being used to provide a personalized, tone-appropriate Virtual Assistant interaction that resonates with each user, at any time.</p>\n<h3>Understanding tone to improve call center experience</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iqventures.com/\">iQVentures</a> is a contact center intelligence company that has developed a platform to get more valuable insights from recorded contact center calls as seen in the dashboard below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IqVentures.png\" alt=\"Snapshot of IQ Venture’s Contact Center Dashboard\" /></p>\n<p>Using Watson Tone Analyzer, iQventures was able to add a tone filter to their platform, enabling customers to search for calls with certain tone levels. By keying in on calls that indicate high levels of anger, sadness, or disgust (tones) customer service teams are able to identify specific calls which required additional attention. This capability has enabled iQventure’s customers to drive faster conflict resolution, reduce repeat calls, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction.</p>\n<h2>Try out Watson Tone Analyzer</h2>\n<p>Try out Watson <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html\">Tone Analyzer</a> today and build your own creative Tone Analyzer apps.

At the beginning of 2014, the governor declared a state of emergency because the dire situation was affecting quality of life, agriculture and business. The state’s water districts needed a firm grasp of water usage patterns, where water was being overused, how much water could be saved, and where to target consumer outreach and education efforts. OmniEarth is helping the State of California analyze aerial images to monitor water consumption on each parcel of land across the state. Using IBM Watson Visual Recognition, OmniEarth adopted a cognitive visual solution that identifies topographical features in images, giving water districts insight into dynamic patterns of water consumption and weather.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://devpost.com/software/dory\">Dory</a> app wins Fishackathon NYC using Watson Visual Recognition</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dory_hackathon.png\" alt=\"Dory app\" /></p>\n<p>Seafood fraud is a global issue affecting everyday consumers, disrupting the global fish market, compromising the health of the marine ecosystem, threatening endangered species, and much more.

class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bluemix_logo_hero_140.png\" alt=\"\" /> Since Bluemix launched, managing your team members and their access has been a fairly tedious operation within each org, space, and region — with no common view across all of these things. This made it difficult to judge which of your orgs, spaces, apps, services, and team members actually live within your Bluemix &#8220;account&#8221; (or within another Bluemix account to which you’ve been invited).</p>\n<p>If you’re a member of multiple orgs (particularly across multiple regions), you feel the pain we’re describing. If you have all of that spanning multiple Bluemix accounts, you REALLY know what we’re talking about. And this becomes even more confusing when you&#8217;re the owner of an account trying to make sense of everything (and everyone) that&#8217;s rolling up into your monthly bill.</p>\n<p>Get excited, because today we&#8217;re finally announcing&#8230;</p>\n<h2>Global Account Management in Bluemix</h2>\n<p>You now have one, easy place to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See and manage all of the Bluemix accounts you&#8217;re a member of</li>\n<li>See all of the people within your account(s) in one view</li>\n<li>Quickly remove any person from your entire account</li>\n<li>Set team member access to all of the orgs and spaces (across all regions) within an account in one view</li>\n<li>See and manage all of the orgs and spaces (across all regions) within an account, in one view</li>\n<li>Bulk invite people to your orgs and spaces (across all regions), including the ability to resend invitations</li>\n<li>Manage org and space access for pending team members, before they&#8217;ve accepted their invitation</li>\n<li>Change your profile settings, including the option to add a picture</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And&#8230; for the pros, we&#8217;ve fixed the pesky &#8220;collaborator&#8221; issue that prevents some org managers from inviting others to the account. All of this is available today within the New Bluemix console. Just click the avatar in the top right and click <a href=\"https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/account/\" target=\"_blank\">account</a>.</p>\n<p><i>Here&#8217;s a closer look at some of the highlights:</i></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>One Place to Manage Everything and Everyone</h2>\n<p>Before today, you had to manage your orgs and spaces (think team member access, domains, quotas) in a separate location from your account at large (think billing, usage, spending notifications). You also had to manage org and space access by region, meaning that if you wanted to add a person to two spaces, one in US-South and one in EU-GB, you had to use the region switcher to move between regions for each addition.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve brought all of that into one common place, and have separated all of the management features by account. And no more region switching either! This will make it much more clear for you to determine which people, orgs, and resources roll up into a given account&#8217;s usage (and monthly bill).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blakes_account.png\" alt=\"Blake's account\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Team Directory</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TeamDirectoryScroll_EmailsRemoved1.gif\" alt=\"TeamDirectoryScroll_EmailsRemoved\" /></p>\n<p>Team management in Bluemix is now way easier. You now have a single view of all of the people across your entire account (in every region). If you&#8217;re an account owner, org manager, or space manager, you can quickly control who has access to your slice of Bluemix.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TeamDirectory_Blurred.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TeamDirectory_Blurred.png\" alt=\"Team Directory\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you own a Bluemix account, you can also remove people from the entire account in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Remove-User-2-1024x575.png\" alt=\"Remove User\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Inviting Team Members</h2>\n<p>We’ve also made inviting people to your Bluemix account quick and intuitive.</p>\n<p>You start by selecting an org&#8230;</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Invite-1.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Invite-1-1024x581.png\" alt=\"Invite \" /></a></p>\n<p>then select any number of spaces (across multiple regions) within the org&#8230;</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Invite-2.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Invite-2-1024x580.png\" alt=\"Invite \" /></a></p>\n<p>and finally send the invitation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/camUnblurred.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/camUnblurred.png\" alt=\"Invites\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can also send invitations to multiple people at the same time. And the email list doesn&#8217;t need to be comma delimited! Just copy/paste any body of text that has a number of emails in it. Got a table of 100 developers&#8217; names and emails that someone just sent you? Just copy paste the entire thing&#8230; and voila!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/InviteTeam_Blurred.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/InviteTeam_Blurred.png\" alt=\"Invite Team\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve invited people, you can view who&#8217;s accepted an invite and who&#8217;s still pending.

They&#8217;ll show up as &#8220;pending&#8221; until they check their email and accept the invitation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TeamDirectoryExpanded_Blurred.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-35171\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TeamDirectoryExpanded_Blurred.png\" alt=\"TeamDirectoryExpanded_Blurred\" width=\"1024\" height=\"580\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Managing Orgs and Spaces</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Add-A-space.gif\" alt=\"Add A space\" /></p>\n<p>You now have a single, global view of all the orgs within your account.

The service employs real-time computation on a vehicle&#8217;s location data stream, offering the following capabilities through REST API calls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed related: Anxious Acceleration, Harsh Brake, Over Speed, Frequent Stop, Frequent Acceleration, Frequent Brake</li>\n<li>Turn related: Sharp Turn (High Speed Turn), Acceleration Before Turn, Break-out Turn</li>\n<li>Others: Fatigue Driving (Tired Driving)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A variety of applications can be built through these services that include navigational assistance, and contextualizing roads and weather incidents. In addition, these services can understand vehicle usage patterns across a cross-section of vehicle owners, fleet operations, rating drivers for insurance risks. Finally, drivers are 10x more likely to get into an accident if they’re distracted, emotional or upset as this might be detected through driving anomalies enabling the vehicle to signal drivers to ensure greater safety.</p>\n<h2>We want your feedback!</h2>\n<p>We appreciate the feedback that we’ve already received and we look for more suggestions to help continue to build these new services for automotive applications.

It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of cross-enterprise business processes. The distributed ledger makes it easier to create cost-efficient business networks where virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded—without requiring a central point of control.  For more information on blockchain technology, please see <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/blockchain\" target=\"_blank\">www.ibm.com/blockchain</a>.</p>\n<h2>What can I do with the IBM Blockchain service?</h2>\n<p>In December 2015, IBM joined the Linux Foundation&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.hyperledger.org\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperledger Project</a> which is a collaborative effort to advance blockchain technology and make it relevant for use cases across all industries.</p>\n<p>With the IBM Blockchain service on Bluemix, you can quickly spin up a blockchain network and circumvent the complexities involved with manually creating a development environment.

href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/10/09/bluemix-zero-downtime-deployment/\">introduction,</a> the Active Deploy service continues to grow adoption; adding new clients both inside and outside of IBM. Using continuous automation testing, we have used client feedback to drive <a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/12/15/bluemix-active-deploy-update/\">new capabilities </a>back into the service. The service performs well under load with excellent reliability, and adds minimal overhead beyond the target application deployment times.</p>\n<h2>New Active Deploy Features</h2>\n<p>Several new features have been added that expand the mission of zero-downtime deployment on Bluemix.</p>\n<p><b>Integration with the IBM Continuous Delivery Pipeline for Bluemix</b> &#8211; Active Deploy now provides automation deployment through an extension in the IBM Continuous Delivery Pipeline for Bluemix. The Delivery Pipeline has an existing process in place to deploy your app to production, but in order to do so, your app must go offline. The Active Deploy extension allows you to use the same deployment process, with no downtime. The post <a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/03/17/bluemix-active-deploy-with-pipeline-integration/\">Bluemix Active Deploy: Pipeline Integration</a> details the steps with additional pointers to tutorial information to get started.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IBM_Pipeline.png\" alt=\"Pipeline\" /></p>\n<p><b>Integration Support for Custom Pipelines</b> &#8211; Based on feedback, we know that some clients have an existing pipeline in their DevOps environment that is not set up in the Continuous Delivery Pipeline. To accommodate users that already have their own custom pipeline, Active Deploy has released a set of scripts so that the service can integrate with nearly any custom pipeline the client may have. The post <a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/05/05/bluemix-active-deploy-custom-pipeline-support/\">Bluemix Active Deploy: Custom Pipeline Support</a> documents an integration method with nearly any custom pipeline the client may have.</p>\n<p><b>Support for Container-based Services</b> &#8211; In addition to supporting services built on Cloud Foundry, clients can use Active Deploy with IBM Containers. The <a href=\"https://admin.blogs.prd.ibm.event.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/03/24/new-deployment-architecture-for-containers/\">recent enhancements</a> to Containers allow Bluemix clients to combine the benefits of Docker, including scalability and portability, with zero-downtime updates.</p>\n<h2>What’s Next</h2>\n<p>You can help us decide! Send us your thoughts and we’ll take your feedback into consideration as we release new features into production. You can submit suggestions to <a href=\"https://ibm-bluemix.uservoice.com/\">IBM Bluemix Ideas</a>, ask questions on <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smartspace/bluemix/\">dW Answers</a> (Bluemix), or just contact the Offering Manager at <a href=\"mailto:drothert@us.ibm.com\">drothert@us.ibm.com</a>. In the meantime, get to know the Active Deploy service, and speed up your deployment process.

We added a new FIPS mode feature, fixed several bugs, and have some news about future buildpack changes. This post summarizes the highlights.</p>\n<h3>FIPS mode</h3>\n<p>Starting with IBM SDK for Node.js 4.3.1, you can use FIPS-enabled IBM SDK for Node.js runtimes to run your app. Simply set the <code>FIPS_MODE</code> environment variable and restage. Using the Cloud Foundry CLI, that would like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">$ cf set-env mtp-node-hw FIPS_MODE true\r\n$ cf restage mtp-node-hw</pre>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3892E25777ED0831.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>You can also set environment variables in the app&#8217;s <a href=\"https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#env-block\" target=\"_blank\">manifest.yml</a> file or through the Bluemix console.</p>\n<p>Also note the following caveats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/app_management.html?cm_mc_uid=66125203796414612664023&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=1461610609\">App Management utilities</a> are currently executed using a separate IBM SDK for Node.js runtime that is not FIPS-enabled, so setting both the BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_ENABLE and FIPS_MODE environment variables will result in the app failing to stage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cli/plugins/dev_mode/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Development mode</a> and FIPS mode can not be used at the same time. The app will fail to stage.</li>\n<li>Requesting an older runtime version that is not FIPS-enabled in conjunction with setting the FIPS_MODE environment variable will also result in the app failing to stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New runtime versions</h3>\n<p>The following IBM SDK for Node.js runtimes were added to the new buildpack: 0.10.44, 0.12.13, 4.4.0, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3.</p>\n<p>The default is now 4.4.3.</p>\n<h2>Future announcements</h2>\n<p>In future versions of the buildpack, we will only be providing the two most recent runtimes for each of 0.10.x, 0.12.x, and 4.x. If you request an older runtime the app will fail to stage. This is more inline with what the <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Foundry Node.js buildpack</a> does. The older runtimes often have known security vulnerabilities, so you are already using the latest ones anyway, right?

At that conference, famed Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman urged scientists to develop an entirely different model of computing, based on quantum physics – and fundamentally, nature. Because it’s been well established for more than a century that the building blocks of nature obey the laws of quantum physics, Feynman proposed that if we could build a computer that also behaved according to quantum mechanics, we’d be able to better simulate nature.</p>\n<p>The implications of building the first universal quantum computer are so significant, it’s often equated to the great space race (in which IBM’s role was also mission-critical). As such, many tech giants have thrown their hats into the quantum ring.</p>\n<p>For more than 20 years, IBM has maintained a research lab dedicated to the transformative promise of quantum computing. It has been IBM’s long-held position that quantum computing is the future of computing. And we believe open access to quantum computing technologies is critical to the advancement of the field.</p>\n<p><b>Today, <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49661.wss\" target=\"_blank\">IBM announced</a> that for the first time in history, quantum computing capabilities have been opened to researchers and scientists worldwide, who can now access IBM’s five-qubit quantum processor on any desktop or mobile device through the IBM Quantum Experience, a first-of-a-kind platform delivered on Bluemix via IBM Cloud.</b></p>\n<p>Until now, many quantum information theorists or scientists have lacked access to actual hardware to test their ideas. Now, through Bluemix as a portal to IBM’s advanced experimental quantum systems, the potential for innovation in quantum computing is no longer limited by such barriers.</p>\n<p>The cloud-enabled <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/quantum/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Quantum Experience</a> will allow users to run algorithms and experiments on IBM’s quantum processor, work with the individual qubits, and explore tutorials and simulations around what might be possible with quantum computing.</p>\n<p>By opening access to the IBM Quantum Experience we believe that we will be able to more quickly break through some of the most perpetuating quandaries challenging quantum researchers.</p>\n<p>In the cloud model, a single quantum computing system can be made available to a global user base, which could, hypothetically, solve the requirement of having an on-prem physical machine.</p>\n<p>We believe this unprecedented advancement will prove mission-critical to taking quantum computing out of the realm of hypothetical and into the realm of practical quantum computers.</p>\n<p>Every once in a while, we get to do something truly special in IBM. This is one of those moments: the birth of quantum cloud computing. This is a moment on which we will we look back years from now, and remember as the beginning of something really important.</p>\n<p>Please join me in celebrating IBM’s major step toward fostering a

Select a Template</h3>\n<p>Select from a pre-defined set of app templates to get started. These templates cover a range of use cases that can be customized as the app is designed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-34123\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1-2-1024x555.png\" alt=\"1-2\" width=\"980\" height=\"531\" /></a></p>\n<h3>2. Design the App</h3>\n<p>Design your app by adding new screens. Use visual tools to select screen and layout types. Customize the app by adding you own colors and images.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-34122\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2-2-1024x512.png\" alt=\"2-2\" width=\"980\" height=\"490\" /></a></p>\n<h3>3. Add Services</h3>\n<p>As part of the app design process, you can add new data sources based on IBM Cloudant NoSQL DB, Online Spreadsheets (Excel Online and Google Sheets), and Google Drive. You can also create your own tables in the cloud or locally stored on the device.</p>\n<p>Add push notifications to the app using the IBM Push Notifications service.</p>\n<p>Optionally, integrate with IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation (MFPF), if you are a current MFPF customer and want to manage this app using MFPF.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-34121\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3-2-1024x420.png\" alt=\"3-2\" width=\"980\" height=\"402\" /></a></p>\n<h3>4. Build and Generate App</h3>\n<p>Once design is done, just select the platform (Android or iOS) and get the app. On successful app creation, you can now download the generated source code or the app binary. For iOS, the source code generated is based on Objective-C (support for Swift is next).</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-34120\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/4-1024x423.png\" alt=\"4\" width=\"980\" height=\"405\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-34119\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5-1024x438.png\" alt=\"5\" width=\"980\" height=\"419\" /></a></p>\n<h3>5. Install App</h3>\n<p>Once the app is built, you have the option to install the app directly on the device via a QR code.

Within this category is device metadata (such as operating system and device model) as well as usage data (such as active users and app sessions). Pre-defined data is collected automatically after you add a few lines of code to initialize the Mobile Analytics SDK within your app.</p>\n<p>With pre-defined metrics you can answer questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many new users do I have?</li>\n<li>How many people are actively using my app?</li>\n<li>How frequently are people using my app?</li>\n<li>What time of day are people using my app?</li>\n<li>What device models do my users prefer?</li>\n<li>When can I deprecate support for legacy operating systems?</li>\n<li>Which apps have performance issues?</li>\n<li>Why is my app crashing?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Custom Events</h3>\n<p>Custom events include data items that you define and that are specific to your app. Usually these items represent events that occur within your app such as page views, button taps, or in-app purchases. In addition to initializing the Mobile Analytics SDK in your app, you must add a line of code for each custom event that you want to track.</p>\n<p>By adding your own custom events, you can answer questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What features are used most and least?</li>\n<li>Where are users entering and leaving my app?</li>\n<li>What activities are users viewing most?</li>\n<li>Are users completing workflows in the app? (for example, conversion funnels)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Client-side Developer Logs</h3>\n<p>Client-side developer logs enable the developer to add lines of code throughout the app that log custom messages to assist in development and debugging. The developer assigns a severity/verbosity level to each log message and can subsequently filter messages by assigned level or preserve storage space by configuring the app to ignore messages below a given level. Client-side logs can be uploaded to the Mobile Analytics console where they can be searched or offloaded for further analysis. To collect client log data, you must initialize the Mobile Analytics SDK within your app, as well as add a line of code for each log message.</p>\n<p>With client-side developer logs, you can answer questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is my app healthy?</li>\n<li>What parts of my app are consistently generating errors and warnings?</li>\n<li>What events led up to a crash?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>IBM Mobile Analytics for Bluemix is an experimental service right now, and we plan to continue adding new features over the coming months.

However, when moving their services to the cloud, some face major challenges creating large scale architectures.</p>\n<p>In a prior blog post, <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2016/02/04/bluemix-service-discovery/\" target=\"_blank\">I announced the beta for Service Discovery</a>, which allows clients to automate the registration of their microservices and to easily find them by logical name. This is a foundational service on Bluemix that has helped both our internal and external clients benefit from microservices. As we were designing Service Discovery, we realized that clients would also benefit from a proxy pattern that would allow them to manage their microservices by leveraging capabilities in load balancing, monitoring, and failure injection testing with minimal code.</p>\n<p>To help our customers manage their services, we are thrilled to announce the beta for <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/service-proxy/\">Service Proxy</a> &#8211; a vital service that helps you to manage your microservices.</p>\n<h2>The Traditional Way &#8211; Managing Microservices Through Code</h2>\n<p>One of the earliest questions with Service Discovery is how to balance the load across microservice instances. Service Discovery simply returns a list of instances based on logical name and leaves it to the client to decide which instance to actually call. In many cases, our clients are inserting their own load balancing code whenever they needed to call a microservice to insure that any one instance was not over burdened with requests.</p>\n<p>In a similar way, most of our clients are concerned with monitoring the performance of their microservices to make sure they were balancing the load correctly and were writing their own code to record and log the performance of each microservice instance. Without this level of visibility, it would be possible for some microservices to take an exceptionally long time to respond, creating issues for their users.</p>\n<p>While writing code that load balances and monitors your transactions is useful, to make a more robust solution, you need to test the failure cases as well. The two most common forms of testing involve injecting either a delay or an explicit failure into the microservice and making sure that the microservice that called it can handle it (see Martin Fowler&#8217;s article on <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html\">the Circuit Breaker pattern</a>).</p>\n<p>Taking a step back from these three major issues most of clients faced, we realized that with a proxy pattern, we could handle this for our clients with a simple-to-use UI. By writing the code for our clients, we allow them to focus on the core business logic of their microservices instead of recreating the same code over and over again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ServiceProxy_Service_Update_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>This is what Service Proxy helps you solve &#8211; automated load balancing, monitoring, and testing your microservice without requiring code beyond the simple call to the Service Proxy.</p>\n<h2>Service Proxy Helps Manage your Microservices Without Adding To Your Work</h2>\n<p>Service Proxy builds on the ease of registration and query built in Service Discovery. Clients use a simple REST API to call Service Proxy with a URL specific to the logical name of the target service. Service Proxy internally calls Service Discovery to retrieve the list of microservice instances and then does a round robin load balancing through that list to minimize performance issues.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ServiceProxy_Architecture_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Service Proxy also tracks the performance of the call to the microservice and tracks this in the Bluemix logging and metering service.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ServiceProxy_Failures_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Service Proxy has a major advantage over other solutions in that it allows you to perform failure injection testing, even in beta. With a few clicks in the UI you can temporarily configure delays and failures through the proxy without altering your microservices. Other solutions lack this key testing capability. In the future we intend to expand this testing to support orderly resilience testing through recipes (via Gremlin from IBM Research). These recipes will take the guesswork out of when you will cause a specific failure and can also help you route failure testing to dedicated failure testing microservice instances. This will significantly harden your microservices to failure, balancing them, and tracking their performance.</p>\n<h2>Ready, set, go!</h2>\n<p>For more details on Service Proxy, see IBM Service Proxy for Bluemix documentation here. Follow the deployment instructions to get started using Service Proxy today. While Service Proxy itself is free, it does internally use IBM Containers and IBM Message Hub, which may incur additional charges to your account.</p>\n<p>Ready to start improving your microservices? <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration\">Try Bluemix</a> and <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/service-proxy/\">Service Proxy</a> today!</p>\n<h2>For more information on Service Discovery &amp; Microservices</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2016/02/04/bluemix-service-discovery/\" target=\"_blank\">Find and Call Your Own Microservices</a> (Bluemix Service Discovery announcement)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvbr5d2mIZs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">How It Works: Cloud Microservices</a> (video introduction)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-bluemix-microservices-in-action-part-1-trs/\">Introduction to microservices</a> (developerWorks)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpieces/abstracts/sg248275.html?Open\">Creating Applications in IBM Bluemix Using the Microservices Approach</a> (IBM Redbook)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Service Discovery service has been retired from the Bluemix Catalog.  Please see the announcement blog post [ <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/11/retirement-of-ibm-service-discovery-and-service-proxy-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/11/retirement-of-ibm-service-discovery-and-service-proxy-services/</a> ] to learn more about the retirement and Amalgam8, our new open source microservice project that will be succeeding these services.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/04/service-proxy-to-balance-monitor-and-test-your-microservices/","date":"2016-04-13T09:00:07","modified":"2017-01-09T10:58:28","format":"standard","slug":"service-proxy-to-balance-monitor-and-test-your-microservices","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=32058","excerpt":"<p> As we were designing Service Discovery, we realized that clients would also benefit from a proxy pattern that would allow them to manage their microservices by leveraging capabilities in load balancing, monitoring, and failure injection testing with minimal code.

This new design allows you, the user, to focus on what you are building &#8211; great apps and infrastructure &#8211; along with a better experience of adding services to the solutions you are building so you can focus on your workflow (see the blog post <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2016/03/01/try-the-new-bluemix-look/\" target=\"_blank\">The new Bluemix Look</a> for more details).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amod_new-console.png\" alt=\"new console\" /></p>\n<p>Now in April, we take the next step: enhancing the SoftLayer customer portal with a complementary style. With this enhancement, users can start interacting with their infrastructure resources and their platform services and both consoles will start to look similar.</p>\n<p>This first change only affects how the SoftLayer customer portal looks. We understand how many users depend on the customer portal every day, and we want to make changes wisely. Right now we are focusing on the main customer portal pages, and over the next few months you’ll see style enhancements appear in other configuration pages.</p>\n<p>Notice that the navigation and links are all the same, but the styles are more in line with IBM Bluemix style.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amod_dashboard2.png\" alt=\"dashboard\" /></p>\n<p>Of course we are just getting warmed up! As stated earlier, our goal is to provide our cloud customers with an integrated experience across all of IBM Cloud Platform.

IBM has added a new service to help monitor security within your IBM cloud, <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/access-trail/\">IBM Access Trail</a>. This new service is now available as a beta offering on Bluemix Public.</p>\n<h2>Security strategies have shifted</h2>\n<p>Security event response has shifted from “blocking the unknown” perimeter defense strategy (building an IT security moat around the enterprise castle) to “blocking the known”, which assumes that the bad guys are already there, so you must quickly find them within your infrastructure and stop them. API Call monitoring is a proven technique in monitoring cloud security. Once a security issue is detected resulting from unusual API activity, the business exposure is limited to how quickly the specific API associated with the breach can be identified and shut down.</p>\n<p>IBM Access Trail captures and records API call logs made by users and applications within the IBM Cloud. In a single place, security system administrators can now gain visibility into API call activities on their cloud platform runtimes and services. Within a single UI management console, API Calls logs are collected then stored for filtering, monitoring, and archiving.</p>\n<h2>Why use IBM Access Trail?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When monitoring API Call logs one may establish a benchmark of daily activity which can be called a &#8220;Proactive Security Benchmark&#8221;. Security administrators will be able to detect when abnormalities occur. Immediate investigation of these deviations from the benchmark can assist in detecting security intrusions or unauthorized access requests.</li>\n<li>Maintaining an API Call log data repository provides for on-demand access to support:<br />\n&#8212; Data security compliance audits<br />\n&#8212; Investigation of cyber security incidents<br />\n&#8212; Forensic analysis<br />\n&#8212; Establishing benchmarks for user behavior patterns</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IBM Access Trail Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloud platform and services API calls are automatically captured across the extended IBM cloud environment and recorded into a single data repository</li>\n<li>Customize the configuration for viewing API call events by various log attributes within a single UI management console</li>\n<li>API Call log monitoring delivers an operational metric which provides security administrators visibility into abnormal activity which can help identify security incidents, detect unauthorized access, and establish benchmarks for user behavior patterns</li>\n<li>Export API Call log files to a legacy or third party SIEM (Security Information &amp; Event Management) solution for extensive security analysis</li>\n<li>Maintain an API Call logs database to support on-demand access</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Start today!</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/access-trail/\">IBM Access Trail</a> is available as a <i>no charge</i> service on Bluemix Public.

The IBM Containers architecture provides enhanced availability of the public cloud offering. New users and new spaces for existing users are running in this environment automatically beginning <b>April 11, 2016</b>.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the new features that are enabled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster time to live for new containers and container groups</li>\n<li>Improved Performance of API calls</li>\n<li>Higher performance ephemeral disk</li>\n<li>Simplified, more resilient network architecture</li>\n<li>Support for Docker engine 1.10</li>\n<li>Docker Registry v2</li>\n<li>Access to container groups over the private network</li>\n<li>Native Docker Compose support (version 1.6.0 or later)</li>\n<li>Auto-scaling container groups (coming later in Q2, stay tuned!)</li>\n<li>VPN service</li>\n<li>URL route mapping across spaces</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How might this announcement affect you?</h3>\n<p>New users and new spaces for existing users are running in this environment automatically beginning <i>April 11, 2016</i>; other users will be need to be migrated.</p>\n<h3>What are your migration options?</h3>\n<p>If you created your space in <b>Dallas before April 11</b> or <b>London before April 25</b>, you can choose to start using these new capabilities immediately or you can wait for it to be migrated for you. Use the following steps to start using these services immediately:</p>\n<p><b>Option 1:</b> If it is acceptable for your service to be down temporarily, we have a new Containers CLI feature to help with your migration. The time for this command to run is proportional to the amount of containers in your current space. For this reason, it could take up to 20 minutes.<br />\n<b>NOTE: </b>With this option, your existing Bluemix services will remain deployed in a given space. Your IP addresses will not migrate and you will have new addresses. <b>Containers will not be re-deployed automatically.</b> Some services may require additional configuration.

If you do not have an edit button to perform this action, your quota allotment does not support this manual migration. You may use the above CLI migration method or contact Chris Rosen (crosen@us.ibm.com) so that we can assist with the remaining steps.</li>\n<li><b>(Optional)</b> If your existing container group in <b>SpaceA</b> is using Bluemix services you will need to follow these steps to get the connection information for these services to use in <b>SpaceB</b> container groups\n<ul>\n<li>Execute &#8220;cf ic inspect &lt;<b>SpaceA</b> group name&gt;&#8221; to get a list of all environment variables.

Creating custom groups of contacts ensures the right notifications reach the right staff, and streamlines the process of determining who to contact when specific problems occur and how to contact them.</li>\n<li><b>Notification channels:</b> Define the IT subject matter experts who can respond to problems in your environment and store their contact details in Alert Notification so that they can be automatically notified of problems in their area of responsibility. Users can be organized into groups and you can send notifications to several users at once. Notifications can be sent by email, SMS, and voice message.</li>\n<li><b>Alert management and notifications:</b> Policy-based notifications let you define which alerts you want Alert Notification to notify you about. You can create filters based on the alerts that occur in your IT environment, customize the filters, and assign users and groups who are notified when matching problems occur. Unacknowledged alerts can be escalated after a set time period to the appropriate contact. Filters such as the severity and status of alerts can be created for your IT monitoring requirements.</li>\n<li><b>Alert viewer:</b> Monitor alert and notification status online, perform actions on alerts, and track them in real-time. Alert severities enable you to easily prioritize your to-do list. You can track: alerts from their receipt by the system through acknowledgment to resolution, changes in the Alert History, and use predefined and real-time filters to designate alerts you want to see.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Utilizing the capabilities in Alert Notification for Bluemix can empower you to improve responsiveness, save resolution time, and focus on actionable notifications requiring immediate attention.

They encapsulate application logic in small, loosely-coupled, distributed services communicating via language-agnostic APIs.</p>\n<p>Despite their benefit, microservice-based solutions remain difficult to build using mainstream cloud technologies, often requiring control of a complex toolchain, and separate build and operations pipelines. Small and agile teams, spending too much time dealing with infrastructural and operational complexities (fault-tolerance, load balancing, auto-scaling, and logging), especially want a way to develop streamlined, value-adding code with programming languages they already know and love and that are best suited to solve particular problems.</p>\n<p>Introducing OpenWhisk, a distributed compute service for developing and executing application logic in response to events.</p>\n<p>OpenWhisk provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A rich set of building blocks that they can easily glue/stitch together</li>\n<li>The ability to focus more on value-adding business logic and less on low-level infrastructural and operational details</li>\n<li>The ability to easily chain together microservices to form workflows via composition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our value proposition and what makes us different is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenWhisk hides infrastructural complexity, allowing developers to focus solely on business logic</li>\n<li>OpenWhisk takes care of low-level details such as scaling, load balancing, logging, fault tolerance, and message queues</li>\n<li>OpenWhisk provides a rich ecosystem of building blocks from various domains (analytics, cognitive, data, IoT, etc.)</li>\n<li>OpenWhisk is open and designed to support an open community</li>\n<li>OpenWhisk supports an open ecosystem that allows sharing microservices via OpenWhisk packages</li>\n<li>OpenWhisk allows developers to compose solutions using modern abstractions and chaining</li>\n<li>OpenWhisk supports multiple runtimes including Node.js, Swift, and any binary programs encapsulated in Docker containers</li>\n<li>OpenWhisk charges only for code that runs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The OpenWhisk model consists of three concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trigger, a class of events that can happen</li>\n<li>Action, an event handler — some code that runs in response to an event</li>\n<li>Rule, an association between a trigger and an action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Services define the events they emit as triggers, and developers define the actions to handle the events. A developer only needs to care about implementing the desired application logic – the system handles the rest.</p>\n<p>Out of the box, OpenWhisk supports Cloudant and Github as event sources as well as the execution of scheduled actions.

response to Swift being open sourced has been amazing. It is just over 2 months since being open sourced, and it is already the most starred, forked, and watched open source language on Github. Since IBM unveiled our <a href=\"https://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Swift Sandbox</a> at the same time, we have seen over 100K users and well over half a million code runs in the Sandbox.</p>\n<h2>Radical Simplification</h2>\n<p>Providing easy access to Swift on Linux is essential to help the community explore and build new server-side capabilities in Swift. In contrast to the process of setting up a new machine, installing Linux, installing Swift system dependencies, and then installing the latest Swift binary releases to then be able to run Swift code on Linux, the IBM Swift Sandbox removes all of these steps for the developer and allows them simply to write Swift code in a web browser and have it run on Linux behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>With this same aim of radical simplification, we are happy to announce the availability of the <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/swift/\">Swift Runtime in IBM Bluemix</a>. This runtime leverages the Cloud Foundry open source <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/swift-buildpack\">swift-buildpack</a>, which allows developers to deploy Swift web applications directly to IBM Bluemix. Upon submission of your Swift Application to Bluemix, Bluemix will host your application by completing the following steps: provide access to a Linux container, load the latest Swift binaries, issue a command to build your application via <a href=\"https://swift.org/package-manager/\">Swift.org&#8217;s Package Manager</a>, run your built application, and finally make your running application available via a public URL.</p>\n<h2>Get Started Now</h2>\n<p>All of this capability is available to Swift developers now on Bluemix! For more information on getting started now with this buildpack, please refer to Ricardo’s blog on our <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/swift/blogs/\">Swift@IBM blog</a>.</p>\n<p>These are exciting times as we continue to work to bring Swift to the Cloud. For more information regarding all of the Swift activities at IBM, please follow us on our <a href=\"http://developer.ibm.com/swift\">Swift@IBM Developer site</a>.</p>\n<p>—Patrick Bohrer (<a

class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GitHub-Mark-small.png\" alt=\"\" /> Just about everyone gets the economics of cloud and OPEX benefits around flexibility and scalability. The harder conversations are around how to rapidly deliver new capabilities at scale, what practices to adopt and how to bring together teams that are working across business boundaries often in their own silos with their own tools and processes. As an IBM Fellow and CTO for IBM Cloud Platform, I spend much of my time working directly with large organizations looking to harness the power of cloud to deliver immediate business value.</p>\n<p>The discussion often boils down to three basic questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I deliver applications securely at much higher velocity?</li>\n<li>How do I attract, train and to retain the most skilled developers and rally them to support needs of the business?</li>\n<li>How do I implement DevOps successfully at scale?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Faster delivery with security and lower cost</h2>\n<p>Today, I am happy to share with you an exciting new partnership with GitHub that will enable our clients to deliver the next generation of cloud applications at higher velocities across secure private and hybrid environments without having to worry about the overhead of running infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Cloud is rapidly changing the way teams design, build, test and deliver software. It’s now essential to have transparency, collaboration, and sharing of source code, in order to deliver the quality an enterprise requires. With demands for compliance and handling of confidential information, including source code and design blueprints, security is paramount.<br />\nThe IBM partnership with GitHub directly addresses these key requirements for development of next generation cloud applications for IBM customers. As part of this agreement we will be providing GitHub Enterprise as a core hybrid service on Bluemix to customers across private and hybrid cloud environments. As a result, IBM customers have a unique opportunity to build software using GitHub Enterprise, on Bluemix Dedicated and Local, thereby allowing their developers to create end-to-end apps within IBM Cloud without having to worry about the overhead costs of building and managing infrastructure.</p>\n<p>With security and safety of the enterprise being first and foremost for us and our customers, the new combined Bluemix and GitHub Enterprise service will also be integrated with the complete set of IBM security scanning technologies to protect enterprise source code from vulnerabilities such as automatic detection of application backdoors through hard-coded user names or passwords. Lastly, in order to boost developer and team productivity, the new offering will be integrated with Bluemix’s broad portfolio of DevOps tools, including the service delivery pipeline and Web IDE services. This represents a major step forward, providing a comprehensive IBM-hosted Hybrid DevOps solution enabling developers to view, collaborate, integrate APIs, iterate, deploy and update on one single platform.</p>\n<h2>Rise of social coding</h2>\n<p>The rise of open source has led to new software development practices. Today’s developers are used to working in an environment that is open, transparent, collaborative, asynchronous and distributed. This has been a major contributing factor in the adoption of open source code management tools like Git – capturing over 50% of the developer audience. The GitHub.com community now has over 12 million developers and 31 million projects.</p>\n<p>Github.com is available for the enterprise with GitHub Enterprise. As a user ourselves, IBM has seen significant improvements not only in terms of the speed and rate at which we deliver software but also how software teams across different departments and business units use an integrated set of best-in-class tools. This approach is yielding results such as reduced delivery times, reduced defects, and improved transparency. In less than six months we have on-boarded some 200 teams and 4,000+ users spread across the globe onto GitHub Enterprise.</p>\n<h2>DevOps at scale</h2>\n<p>With 40,000 developers worldwide at IBM we recognized many of our clients share our challenges. Acknowledging that tools and technology are only part of the answer, we have shared our experiences and the practices that work as the IBM Bluemix Garage Method, which we announced in October last year.</p>\n<p>The method provides a transformative approach to application delivery combining industry best practices based on design thinking, lean, agile, DevOps and cloud principles. In addition to providing prescriptive guidance for specific roles and use cases, Bluemix Garage Method provides guidance on DevOps toolchains. It can be nontrivial to acquire and integrate the necessary tools. IBM Bluemix is implementing an open toolchain platform that allows developers to define and standardize their DevOps toolchains, by selecting, integrating, configuring and organizing the best of open, third-party and IBM technologies to deliver innovative applications using a DevOps methodology. Toolchains recommended by Bluemix Garage Method will be provided out of the box in Bluemix – GitHub Enterprise is a core component of these recommended toolchains.</p>\n<h2>Don’t miss the live coverage</h2>\n<p>I encourage everyone to join us – in person at the Mandalay Bay Event Center in Las Vegas or <a href=\"https://ibmgo.com/interconnect/\" target=\"_blank\">online with IBMgo</a> on Wednesday, Feb 24 at 8:30 am PST in our InterConnect 2016 DevOps &amp; Open Technologies keynote where we are talking about open toolchains and tools, including GitHub Enterprise.

This is especially true for enterprises with sensitive data in databases that must remain on-premises in order to address security and compliance requirements.</p>\n<p>Many clients approach IBM and ask &#8220;How can I utilize my existing on-premise databases with an on-premise cloud?&#8221; Bluemix Local addresses the challenge of delivering an on-premise cloud that successfully balances cost, agility and quality of service. It also provides an expansive cloud strategy that includes a mixture of on and off-premises infrastructure and services.</p>\n<p>Bluemix Local by itself helps clients address these challenges but requires the client to build a custom broker to enable access to on-premise resources like existing databases. Today we are announcing an IBM recommended partner solution to enhance Bluemix Local &#8211; Blue Broker from Cloudsoft, that will enable you to rapidly utilize your existing on-premise databases in Bluemix.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1_Cloudsoft_Service_Broker_Landing_Page_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Without Cloudsoft: Roll your own broker</h2>\n<p>To put an entry into the catalog on Bluemix Local, you must utilize a broker that not only connects you to the resource but performs lifecycle management like creating and removing the instance if necessary. Until now, most service brokers have dealt with a single type of service, requiring a lot of up-front investment to make a new service available in Bluemix and limiting the degree to which these services can be customized when needed for applications.</p>\n<h2>With Cloudsoft: Automated service management</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2_Cloudsoft_Service_Broker_Dropdown_Menu_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /> In contrast to the tedious, manual way of exposing local services like MySQL to Bluemix Local, Blue Broker – the Bluemix Edition of the Cloudsoft Service Broker – acts as a bridge between Bluemix and Cloudsoft&#8217;s Application Management Platform (AMP).<br />\nCloudsoft AMP is Cloudsoft&#8217;s flagship product built on the top-level Apache Brooklyn open source project. Cloudsoft AMP lets you model applications and capture their operational best practices in open standard blueprints that can be deployed, monitored and managed on any cloud. It integrates with Cloud Foundry, enabling developers to reach back and integrate with enterprise services while exploiting cloud-first platforms whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Once Blue Broker is installed in your Bluemix environment, adding your existing on-premise database to the Bluemix Local catalog for your developers will only take a matter of minutes to set up. This will greatly speed up your developers and allow them to work on new capability to improve your business agility, all while keeping your secure data secure on premise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3_Blue-Broker-Graphic_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>An admin console helps operations expose their existing database services to Bluemix developers in a secure automated fashion.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4_Cloudsoft_Service_Broker_Create_Database_Bridge_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Once the key database parameters are provided, Cloudsoft makes these services available in the catalog and provides complete lifecycle management of them through Blue Broker.</p>\n<h2>How Blue Broker works</h2>\n<p>Cloudsoft generalizes the concept of a Cloud Foundry service broker.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/v2services-new_edited.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>The blueprints that model your applications (which are typically written in YAML according to the CAMP specification) can be stored in AMP’s blueprint catalog. These catalog items are returned by Blue Broker in the Fetch Catalog operation. When <i>Provision Instance</i> is called, Blue Broker passes this request on to AMP to implement the external service e.g. create a read-only database user suitably permissioned; stand up a production grade data service; and so on. After the instance has been provisioned, the call to <i>Create Binding</i> then requests credentials from AMP for the application and these populate the Bluemix environment so that your Bluemix application can interact with the AMP application as a Bluemix <i>service.</i></p>\n<h2>Cloudsoft showcasing Blue Box, SoftLayer and Bluemix support @ IBM InterConnect</h2>\n<p>Cloudsoft is a Silver Plus sponsor of IBM InterConnect 2016 which is taking place at the MGM Grand &amp; Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas February 21 – 25. Make sure you allow time to visit Cloudsoft at the InterConnect Expo, stand #558, where they will be showcasing Cloudsoft AMP deploying and managing Basho Riak KV Enterprise in multi-cluster replication mode utilizing IBM Blue Box in San Jose backed up by IBM SoftLayer in Seattle.</p>\n<p>Cloudsoft will also be demonstrating how simple it is for IBM Bluemix developers to leverage existing data services via Blue Broker, the Bluemix Edition of the Cloudsoft Service Broker. Finally Cloudsoft will be highlighting its integration with the Incontinuum Cloud Controller.</p>\n<h2>Where to get additional information</h2>\n<p>The initial use case for Blue Broker is narrowly focused on exposing on-premise database services to Bluemix Local developers. However, given the power of Cloudsoft AMP, it is easy to see that in the future we may be able leverage this solution for a broader set of use cases including exposing other services and creating resources through AMP on your Blue Box environment.<br />\nAs a recommended IBM partner solution we suggest you look at the resources on <a href=\"http://www.cloudsoftcorp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudsoft</a> and contact them directly with projects that will benefit from this new innovation.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/02/blue-broker-from-cloudsoft/","date":"2016-02-22T00:30:18","modified":"2016-12-07T16:23:59","format":"standard","slug":"blue-broker-from-cloudsoft","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=31240","excerpt":"<p>Today we are announcing an IBM recommended partner solution to enhance Bluemix Local &#8211; Blue Broker from Cloudsoft.

Message Connect is a service which enables you to feed events from a variety of sources into <a href=\"http://ibm.biz/message-hub-bluemix-catalog\" target=\"_blank\">Message Hub</a>. So, if you want to get events from sources such as Twitter into your Bluemix apps, this is the easiest way to achieve it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/message_connect_topology.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Rather than build connectors for a wide range of event sources directly into Message Hub, we&#8217;ve decided to create a separate service. This will enable us to add new event sources more easily and also to build additional features into the connectors. To start with, we support four event sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Force.com</li>\n<li>Cloudant</li>\n<li>MQ Light</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a lot of similarity to the earlier Event Hub service and the capabilities are broadly the same. Behind the scenes, a lot has changed. For example, we&#8217;ve changed the way that messages are published into Message Hub to get better efficiency and reliability.</p>\n<h2>Message Connect and hybrid cloud messaging</h2>\n<p>Using Message Connect to bridge from on-premise MQ queue managers into Message Hub is important for hybrid cloud messaging. That&#8217;s all about connecting MQ to the cloud. The connector that enables this is the MQ Light connector. To start with, Message Connect can only flow messages from MQ into Message Hub, but in the future we want to add support for sending messages in the other direction.</p>\n<p>Most people using the MQ Light connector will actually use it with the Secure Gateway service to create a secure connection to an on-premise MQ queue manager. Using the Secure Gateway, you don&#8217;t have to expose the queue manager directly to the public internet. Instead, you use a Secure Gateway client on an on-premise server to initiate a connection to Bluemix, thus creating a secure tunnel which you can use to connect safely to MQ. We&#8217;ve added code in Message Connect to get the configuration of your Secure Gateway destinations while you&#8217;re setting up Message Connect, so you no longer need to note down an IP address.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>To get started, you&#8217;ll need to create an instance of <a href=\"http://ibm.biz/message-hub-bluemix-catalog\" target=\"_blank\">Message Hub</a> and <a href=\"http://ibm.biz/message-connect-bluemix-catalog\" target=\"_blank\">Message Connect</a> in Bluemix. Then you can create a stream in Message Connect to receive events from one of our supported event sources. You can consume the event data from Message Hub using a Kafka client or REST API in an app, or using another service such as Streaming Analytics.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/02/new-message-connect-service/","date":"2016-02-15T07:00:33","modified":"2016-12-07T16:32:04","format":"standard","slug":"new-message-connect-service","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=30197","excerpt":"<p>I’m delighted to announce the availability of our new experimental service, Message Connect.

Today IBM is adding a new service to help you build security into your cloud.</p>\n<p>IBM Key Protect is an encryption key management service that offers a simple and economical key management solution for managing keys that are used to encrypt data at rest in the cloud. IBM Key Protect manages the entire lifecycle of keys from key creation through application use, key archival, and key destruction, while also enforcing separation of duties between data management and key management.</p>\n<p>Company policies, industry best practices, and government regulations increasingly require encryption key management in addition to data encryption to be included as fundamental components of overall data storage, data management, and data governance. IBM Key Protect helps clients secure their cloud by encrypting sensitive data from unauthorized access while meeting compliance auditing standards (internal &amp; external) by providing the mandatory control of user access requests to create, open, or delete encryption keys.</p>\n<h2>Features of IBM Key Protect</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows any encryption-capable block storage, object storage, database, or internal application to use REST APIs for integrating encryption capabilities with IBM Key Protect eliminating the need to spend the time or effort building proprietary (and often insecure) solutions to protect encryption keys.</li>\n<li>Provides the ability to delete keys without any residual copies remaining, thereby rendering any data encrypted under those keys cryptographically-erased. Once the encryption keys are deleted, you can be assured your data is no longer retrievable, regardless of the application or cloud that stored it.</li>\n<li>Supports built in security based upon ridged FIPS-140-2 Level 2 certified hardware security modules (HSM) located within secure IBM SoftLayer data centers.</li>\n<li>Gives cloud system administrators the ability to easily manage their encryption keys while creating roll-based employee access to data via a simple graphical user interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Start using IBM Key Protect today!</h2>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net/catalog/services/key-protect/\">IBM Key Protect</a> in the Bluemix Dallas Region catalog under the Security section.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/02/ibm-key-protect-beta/","date":"2016-02-10T11:00:40","modified":"2017-01-20T10:55:14","format":"standard","slug":"ibm-key-protect-beta","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=30660","excerpt":"<p>IBM Key Protect is an encryption key management service that offers a simple and economical key management solution for managing keys that are used to encrypt data at rest in the cloud.

Application Security on Cloud was built with one thing in mind—making application security testing a simple task, one that can be executed by any developer.</p>\n<p>Let me show you in just 4 simple steps how easy it is to scan a mobile Android application. With this service, you can of course also scan iOS mobile apps, or web or desktop apps.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: choose Mobile as the application type</h3>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/app-type.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 2: choose Android as the mobile platform</h3>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/iOS-vs-Android.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 3: upload the application you want to scan</h3>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/apk1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 4: name your scan and run it</h3>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/apk2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>As IBM Application Security on Cloud is a fully-automated service your scan will immediately start (depends on scans queue) and once completed you will be able to download a detailed security report that holds information about all the detected security vulnerabilities, explanation about those and how to remediate them. Sample reports are found in the next section. Application Security on Cloud can be automated and extended through its robust but simple API; see <a href=\"https://appscan.ibmcloud.com/swagger/ui/index\" target=\"_blank\">API for managing AppScan SaaS scans</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Sample Security Reports</h2>\n<p>Security reports provide detailed information about the security issues discovered. In the case of web apps, Regulatory Compliance reports, that let you know if your app complies with specific regulations and legal standards, are also available. The following sample reports show the structure and scope of a full IBM Application Security on Cloud report.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://appscan.bluemix.net/common/SampleReports/iOS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sample Security Report for an iOS mobile app</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://appscan.bluemix.net/common/SampleReports/Android.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sample Security Report for an Android mobile app</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://appscan.bluemix.net/common/SampleReports/DAST.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sample Security Report for a web app</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://appscan.bluemix.net/common/SampleReports/DastPci.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sample Industry Standard Report for a web app</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://appscan.bluemix.net/common/SampleReports/SAST.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sample Security Report for Static Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that users of the free plan can access only a summary report.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/02/securing-apps-simplified-with-bluemix/","date":"2016-02-09T02:00:11","modified":"2016-12-07T16:24:22","format":"standard","slug":"securing-apps-simplified-with-bluemix","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=30054","excerpt":"<p>You probably believe your application might be the next big thing.

Thanks to the new Application Security on Cloud for Bluemix, you can protect your application from the most commonly used attacks without needing to be a security expert. </p>\n","menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America/New_York","date_gmt":"2016-02-09T07:00:11","modified_tz":"America/New_York","modified_gmt":"2016-12-07T21:24:22","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/30054","author":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/305","collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts","replies":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/30054/comments","version-history":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/30054/revisions"}},"featured_image":null,"terms":{"post_tag":[{"ID":639,"name":"announcements","slug":"announcements","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":159,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/announcements/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/639"}}},{"ID":599,"name":"security","slug":"security","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":33,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/security/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/599"}}}],"category":[{"ID":559,"name":"Community","slug":"community","description":"<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-orange-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-categories-_-general\">Get started with Bluemix today</a></p>","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":559,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/category/community/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/559"}}},{"ID":1813,"name":"Security","slug":"security","description":"Customize cloud security\r\n\r\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-orange-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-categories-_-securityRegisterforBluemix\">Get started free</a></p>  \r\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/security/?cm_sp=Blog-_-categories-_-securitylearnmore\">Learn more about security</a></p>","taxonomy":"category","parent":{"ID":1789,"name":"Products","slug":"products","description":"","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":4,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/category/products/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/1789"}}},"count":21,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/category/products/security/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/1813"}}},{"ID":1963,"name":"What's New","slug":"whats-new","description":"<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-orange-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-categories-_-general\">Get started with Bluemix today</a></p>","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":273,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/category/whats-new/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/1963"}}}]}},{"ID":29835,"title":"Updates to Accessibility Service on Bluemix","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":297,"username":"thbrunet@us.ibm.com","name":"Thomas A Brunet","first_name":"Thomas A","last_name":"Brunet","nickname":"thbrunet@us.ibm.com","slug":"thbrunetus-ibm-com","URL":"","avatar":"","description":"","registered":"2016-09-22T14:35:41+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/297","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/297/posts"}}},"content":"<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blue-shield-200.png\" alt=\"blue-shield-200\" width=\"184\" height=\"200\" /> IBM has added new functionality to its <a href=\"https://ibm.biz/bluemix-dcc\">IBM Digital Content Checker for Bluemix</a>, improving the ability to securely check the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/able\">accessibility</a> of large collections of content. This capability is most useful for teams that are doing continuous builds of EPUB or HTML documents. The Digital Content Checker allows users to easily verify the accessibility of HTML content or EPUB documents. The service quickly examines your content, provides a detailed report of all accessibility violations, and then recommends how to fix the issues so the content conforms to industry standards and government regulations before being published.</p>\n<h2>Verify the accessibility of local content</h2>\n<p>With the addition of the Batch Scan Tool, users can now verify the accessibility of directories or other listings of content locally. The new tool can provide value when integrated into automated build processes, typical of DevOps environments, as it provides accessibility feedback throughout the content lifecycle, while developing content, editing it, and for final review before publishing. Digital Content Checker is also designed to be customized for an organization&#8217;s internal content development workflow processes.</p>\n<p>The locally run scans improve performance and security by eliminating transfer of the content being tested, while still leveraging the accessibility testing expertise provided by IBM Accessibility. After each document or HTML page is scanned, users will receive a report outlining all violations based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA standards, in addition to rules that IBM has identified to enhance the accessibility of web applications.</p>\n<p>Each issue also contains a description that provides more information about the violation and links for more information on how to correct the issue. The reports can also be downloaded as a CSV file and shared as a spreadsheet. The accessibility reports can be valuable for all forms of content, such as product documentation, educational materials, and web pages.</p>\n<h2>For more information:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Watch a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nY07xKm7uI8\">video overview</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/53sPZ-70_M0\">demo</a> of the service</li>\n<li>Read the <a href=\"https://www.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ecschecker/index.html#using-the-batch-scan-tool\">Getting Started</a> documentation</li>\n<li>Sign up for a <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/able/accessibility_research_projects/bluemix_services.html\">free trial</a> of Digital Content Checker</li>\n</ul>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/02/accessibility-service-update/","date":"2016-02-09T00:30:43","modified":"2016-12-07T16:32:07","format":"standard","slug":"accessibility-service-update","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=29835","excerpt":"<p>IBM has added new functionality to its IBM Digital Content Checker for Bluemix, improving the ability to securely check the accessibility of large collections of content.

This may cause your application to behave differently if you have not specified a particular version for your application. To learn how to specify a version of Node.js for your Bluemix application, check out <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/nodejs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Creating Apps with SDK for Node.js</a> on our docs.</li>\n<li><code>NODE_ENV</code> is now set to <code>production</code> by default.\n<ul>\n<li>This will cause some node dependencies to behave differently.  For example, the Express framework will no longer return stacktraces in the web browser for faulty endpoints, but instead just display &#8220;Internal Server Error&#8221;.</li>\n<li>When <code>NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION</code> is set to <code>true</code>, NPM sets <code>NODE_ENV</code> to <code>production</code> for subshell scripts in the npm install phase <em>only</em>. This allows users to set <code>NODE_ENV</code> to another value like <code>development</code> for application runtime.  For clarity, npm scripts will see <code>NODE_ENV=<strong>production</strong></code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Caching updates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If cache is disabled (<code>NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false</code>) the buildpack will not attempt to cache any modules/components. Previously this setting made it so that the cache is not popped, but it would still cache the installed modules for future deploys.  Now it will neither pop the cache nor attempt to store any cache.</li>\n<li>bower_components is cached by default in addition to node_modules.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other updates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Helpful warnings for missing dependencies like <i>gulp</i>, <i>bower</i>, and <i>angular</i>.</li>\n<li>Updated detect script with buildpack version information.</li>\n<li>Clustering recommendation (<code>WEB_CONCURRENCY</code>) initially introduced by community is removed as memory determination was inaccurate on Bluemix.</li>\n<li>StrongPM handler in App Management Framework now works for 0.10.x and 4.x, in addition to 0.12.x.

In many cases enterprise customers move large monolithic legacy business services to the cloud that are costly to maintain and update, and miss out on the benefits of modern software architecture including microservices.</p>\n<p>A microservice architecture allows developers to break down large, traditionally monolithic service into smaller, more dynamic services that follow a well defined interface. This allows for focused development of a specific business capability that limits the impacts of a service failure, improves the upgrade experience of a service, and better protects the long term investment of the overall solution through replaceable services.</p>\n<p>To help our customers build more success services, today we are thrilled to announce Service Discovery &#8211; a vital service that helps you to start using microservices today.</p>\n<h2>Success starts with Microservices</h2>\n<p>Microservices is an architectural style in which large, complex software services are decomposed into one or more smaller services with a well defined interface. Each of these microservices focuses on completing one task that represents a small business capability.</p>\n<p>The business benefits of a microservice design include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limiting the impact of failures of a service – by splitting up a large monolithic service into separate services you immediately limit the impact of failure or update<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/discovery_failure_diagram.png\" alt=\"\" /></li>\n<li>Reducing the validation costs of a service – By reducing the scope of a service and creating a well defined interface you can better utilize automated testing to reduce validation costs</li>\n<li>Focusing development teams and requirements – narrower scope enables a smaller teams of developers to focus on delivering a smaller set of specific requirements, more rapidly</li>\n<li>Protect long term development investment – Well defined interfaces that form a contract – this allows you to minimize the investment in any one version of any one component.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a critical challenge when switching to a microservice design before you can claim these benefits. How do you find available instances of your microservice to call?</p>\n<p>In a monolithic application, services invoke one another through language-level method or procedure calls, while in a traditional distributed system deployment, services run at fixed, well known locations and so can easily call one another.</p>\n<p>A modern microservice-based application typically runs in a virtualized or containerized environments where the number of instances of a service and their locations constantly changes dynamically.</p>\n<p>This is the problem that Service Discovery solves. It helps clients of a microservice find an available instance of a microservice that they can call.</p>\n<h2>Service Discovery makes Microservices work without adding to your work</h2>\n<p>Now you can benefit from microservices: The Service Discovery service on Bluemix offers easy microservice registration, and a simple API for finding instances based on logical names. Service Discovery supports an intuitive REST API that works with any programming language and allows you to quickly locate your services.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/discovery_operations_diagram.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Service Discovery has a major advantage over other solutions is it allows you to start building your own microservices without the hassle and worry of having to maintain your own service registry. Other solutions require you to setup and maintain their software within your environment manually. Service Discovery allows Bluemix users all the benefits of using microservices today at no cost.</p>\n<h2>Ready, set, go!</h2>\n<p>For more details on Service Discovery, see the <a href=\"http://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ServiceDiscovery/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Service Discovery for Bluemix documentation</a>.

However, finding the exact answer buried inside these documents can be an impossible task. For example, imagine that you are trying to investigate a commercial router, and you are stuck setting it up for remote access. If you&#8217;re in this situation, you might begin by narrowing it down to a specific product, and then to a product series, and then maybe to a model, and then even to a model year. All of this just to find list of documents that may be of help. And they still don&#8217;t necessarily have the answer to your question! You still may have to shift through 10s and even 100s of documents until you, maybe, get to the answer you are looking for. The Document Conversion service can help you to solve this issue!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many organizations have 1000s of documents and finding an exact answer buried inside these documents can be an impossible task.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Document Conversion Service can convert all of your documents into Answer units which can then be indexed in an instance of the Retrieve and Rank Service and used by Watson to answer questions. There is sample code that shows you how to connect Document Conversion to Retrieve and Rank.

Although the original announcement stated that your existing instances will continue to be fully operational until December 15, 2016, we have found that the majority of our users have already migrated to take advantage of the newer services. In March 2016, IBM reached out by email to the few remaining active users with a goal of helping respondents accelerate migration to our new services. All active users who responded completed migration by the end of May 2016, at which time the services were no longer operational. The Mobile Data service has been extended until the end of June 2016 to enable the remaining customers to migrate to the Cloudant NoSQL DB service​. Migration help is available in the links that follow for any users who did not receive notification and/or were not able to respond.</p>\n<p>The Mobile Quality Assurance service is not affected by this change and continues to be fully operational.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the recommended actions?</strong><br />\nStart to consider migrating your mobile app to use the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate, which, like the Mobile Cloud boilerplate, includes services for security and analytics (Mobile Client Access), push (Push Notifications), and data (Cloudant NoSQL DB).</p>\n<p>For more information about how to migrate to the new services, see the information in the Mobile Cloud services documentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/mas/index.html#mas_migration\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Application Security</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/mobiledata/index.html#data_migration\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/push/index.html#push_migration\" target=\"_blank\">Push</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Some history&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Two years ago, the IBM MobileFirst team released an initial set of mobile backend services on Bluemix, that we called our &#8220;first generation&#8221; mobile services. Together, these services provided a back end for mobile applications that enabled developers to focus on developing great front end applications without having to worry about setting up a back end. The services included a security service (Mobile Application Security), a push notification service (Push), and a data service (Mobile Data) that were packaged together in the Mobile Cloud boilerplate.</p>\n<p>Since that set of services went live, we learned a lot about how developers use services, both in development and in production. We also learned a lot within our teams about building cloud services in the best way.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, we released a second set of services that cover the same functionality. This set of services is packaged together in the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate, and includes security and analytics (Mobile Client Access), push (Push Notifications), and data (Cloudant NoSQL DB). This second set of services is improved in every way. They are more robust, scalable, efficient, and developer friendly. With the new services, you can build iOS, Android, and Cordova applications. Each of the new services has a detailed Getting Started guide with samples and tutorials. You can use these tutorials to get familiar with new services.</p>\n<p>We really want our users to take advantage of the best we have to offer, and we feel that you should be building your apps with our new services.

This will allow us to have greater control over our own support system as well as increase robustness and stability across the entire service.</p>\n<p>In an effort to provide more robust security around your gateways and clients, we have begun embedding expiration dates within the JWT associated with a gateway. When a gateway is created, a JWT is created with a default expiration date of 90 days from the creation date; however, if you want that to be shorter, longer, or even if you never want it to expire, you can specify that during the creation process.</p>\n<h2>Client Updates</h2>\n<p><strong>High Availability Support:</strong> With this release, the Secure Gateway Client now supports high availability. Be connecting multiple clients to the same gateway, all destination supported by that gateway will now be distributed in a round-robin fashion between the connected clients. In this way, if one client goes down, there can be another one available to pick up the slack immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Gateway Connections:</strong> Hand-in-hand with the high availability, we now also provide a new mode of functionality on the client. The new multi-gateway client will allow multiple gateway connections to be created from a single client instance rather than requiring a new client for each gateway connection. If you wanted to take advantage of the new High Availability with the multi-gateway client, you could create multiple connections to the same gateway in the client and then interact with them all from a single, unified interface, rather than juggling multiple single-gateway clients.</p>\n<p>While the interactive experience of the multi-gateway client is largely the same as the single-gateway client, there are some differences in how existing commands are passed to the various connections as well as some new commands unique to the multi-gateway client. For more information on starting up a new client in multi-gateway mode, see <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/SecureGateway/sg_021.html#sg_052\">Interacting with the Secure Gateway client</a>. For more information on interacting with a multi-gateway client, see <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/SecureGateway/sg_022.html#sg_010\">Secure Gateway client interactive command-line interface</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Bi-directional Connections:</strong> With our traditional on-premises destinations, we are capable of providing a cloud access point to an on-premises resource. By combining the traditional on-premises destination with our new cloud destination, we achieve complete bidirectional support. The new cloud destination allows an on-premises service/application to send information/requests to a cloud application via the Secure Gateway Client.</p>\n<p><i>On-premises destination:</i><br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/onPremDestFlow_edited.png\" alt=\"on-prem destination flow\" /></p>\n<p><i>Cloud destination:</i><br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cloudDestFlow_edited.png\" alt=\"cloud destination flow\" /></p>\n<h2>UI Updates</h2>\n<p>Alongside all of our client changes, the UI has been updated in quite a few places as well. In order to provide more consistency between our display of gateways and destinations, we have moved the &#8216;Add Gateway&#8217; option into a button that appears in-line with any existing destination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/addDestination_edited.png\" alt=\"add destination\" /></p>\n<p>In tandem with our bidirectional support, we have added a new option for you when creating a destination. If you would like to create a traditional destination to an on-premises resource, you can select the on-premises destination option; otherwise, you can select the new cloud destination. The new type of destination will be the same as the on-premises destination with the exception of a new field to define which port the Secure Gateway Client will be listening on.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cloudDestination.png\" alt=\"cloud destination\" /></p>\n<p>Previously, once a gateway was created, there was no way to update any of the associated information. With the addition of embedded expiration dates in the gateway&#8217;s JWT, we have also provided a way to modify the details of a gateway. From the Edit Gateway panel, you can update the description, decide whether or not a newly connected client will require the JWT, if you want your JWT to contain an expiration date, or if you want a new JWT all together with your new expiration date.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/editGateway_edited.png\" alt=\"edit gateway\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c  no-repeat scroll 3px 50% / 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer;\">Save</span></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/12/ibm-secure-gateway-updates-version-140/","date":"2015-12-15T02:00:18","modified":"2016-12-07T16:32:40","format":"standard","slug":"ibm-secure-gateway-updates-version-140","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=27390","excerpt":"<p>With the release of version 1.4.0, IBM Secure Gateway for Bluemix announces a number of key changes we believe you’ll enjoy!

After a couple of months as a beta service, it&#8217;s now progressed to a fully fledged, generally available service. Message Hub brings the power and scale of Apache Kafka to the IBM Bluemix cloud.</p>\n<p>As far as we know, this is the first multi-tenant, cloud-hosted service based on Kafka. It makes it very quick and easy to experiment with Kafka and Bluemix, whether you&#8217;re writing an application using a <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/rt_landing.html\" target=\"_blank\">runtime environment</a> such as Node.js, a Docker <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html\" target=\"_blank\">container</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/virtualmachines/vm_index.html\" target=\"_blank\">virtual machine</a>, or integrating with other Bluemix services.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s changed since the start of the beta? Well, quite a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Message Hub is based on the new Kafka 0.9 release.</b> We chose the brand new Kafka 0.9 because it brings support for encrypting client connections using TLS and providing credentials using SASL when you connect, both very important in a service on a public cloud. Kafka 0.9 has just been finalised by the community, fortunately just before we released Message Hub. Since the start of the beta, we&#8217;ve moved in a sequence of steps from an early build of Kafka to the final release candidate. Along the way, things have stabilised a lot, and we were able to quietly upgrade to the latest level without disruption. In the future, as maintenance releases become available, we&#8217;ll try them out in our staging environment and promote into production for public use. That&#8217;s the beauty of continuous delivery.\n<p>For simple maintenance updates, we expect to be able to upgrade with no impact on existing applications. If a future Kafka release introduces features which are in some way not compatible, we&#8217;ll have to cross that bridge when we come to it.</li>\n<li><b>Message Hub now has a UI in the Bluemix dashboard.</b> This is obviously a big step forward in usability. It&#8217;s very simple at this point, basically letting you manage your topics visually as well as the existing REST API. Over time, we expect to add more features such as letting you increase the number of partitions for topics for added scalability.\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MsgHubUI.jpg\" alt=\"Message Hub UI\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" /></li>\n<li><b>Improvements to how the service is deployed.</b> We&#8217;ve done performance analysis to locate and resolve bottlenecks. In a public cloud system, there are necessarily many moving parts so it&#8217;s a complex system consisting of much more than just Kafka. We&#8217;ve started encrypting the messages at rest, so even if someone were to steal the disk drives from inside our datacenter, they would still have to decrypt them to read the messages. And we&#8217;ve done a lot of work to get the multi-region support just right so we can deliver data sovereignty.</li>\n<li><b>More integrated services with Message Hub.</b> For example, Alex Pogue has written an article about <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/10/16/streaming-analytics-message-hub\" target=\"_blank\">how to connect the Streaming Analytics service to Message Hub</a>. Since Kafka is ideally suited to delivering data to analytics systems, this is a great combination. Why not use Alex&#8217;s article as a starting point for experimenting with these technologies yourself?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that&#8217;s Message Hub is out of beta, it follows the usual Bluemix pay-as-you-go model. When you create a new Bluemix account, you can use the Message Hub service for free for 30 days. After that, how much you pay depends on how you use it. The price is based on two factors: the number of topics and the volume of messages you send and receive.</p>\n<p>We still have loads more to do. For example, the native Kafka API is clearly aimed at people experienced with middleware, so we&#8217;re also working towards providing the more straightforward <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/mq-light/\" target=\"_blank\">MQ Light API</a> available in Message Hub too. Then you&#8217;ll be able to use the same MQ Light API on a developer laptop with the free MQ Light SDK <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/mq-light/\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>, in the datacenter with IBM MQ, or on the cloud with the new Message Hub service.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested to see IBM&#8217;s latest cloud messaging offering, look for IBM Message Hub in Bluemix, write some code or connect it up with another service, and give it a try. You can get going with our <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm-messaging/message-hub-samples\" target=\"_blank\">samples</a>, or read the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/MessageHub/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> and use it from your own code.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/12/message-hub-goes-live/","date":"2015-12-14T03:00:58","modified":"2016-12-07T16:32:42","format":"standard","slug":"message-hub-goes-live","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=27101","excerpt":"<p>I’m very pleased to tell you about the release of the new IBM Message Hub service in IBM Bluemix.

It makes it very quick and easy to experiment with Kafka and Bluemix, whether you’re writing an application using a runtime environment such as Node.js, a Docker container or a virtual machine, or integrating with other Bluemix services. </p>\n","menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America/New_York","date_gmt":"2015-12-14T08:00:58","modified_tz":"America/New_York","modified_gmt":"2016-12-07T21:32:42","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/27101","author":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/205","collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts","replies":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/27101/comments","version-history":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/27101/revisions"}},"featured_image":{"errors":{"json_post_invalid_type":["Invalid post type"]},"error_data":{"json_post_invalid_type":{"status":400}}},"terms":{"post_tag":[{"ID":565,"name":"analytics","slug":"analytics","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":40,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/analytics/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/565"}}},{"ID":639,"name":"announcements","slug":"announcements","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":159,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/announcements/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/639"}}},{"ID":561,"name":"Bluemix","slug":"bluemix","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":508,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/bluemix/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/561"}}},{"ID":573,"name":"cloud","slug":"cloud","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":44,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/cloud/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/573"}}},{"ID":567,"name":"messaging","slug":"messaging","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":9,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/messaging/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/567"}}},{"ID":683,"name":"microservices","slug":"microservices","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":29,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/microservices/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/683"}}}],"category":[{"ID":1963,"name":"What's New","slug":"whats-new","description":"<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-orange-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-categories-_-general\">Get started with Bluemix today</a></p>","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":273,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/category/whats-new/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/1963"}}}]}},{"ID":27296,"title":"Migrate to the new IBM DataWorks","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":215,"username":"rcarey@us.ibm.com","name":"Roberta Carey","first_name":"Roberta","last_name":"Carey","nickname":"rcarey@us.ibm.com","slug":"rcareyus-ibm-com","URL":"","avatar":"","description":"","registered":"2016-09-22T14:35:08+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/215","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/215/posts"}}},"content":"<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dataworks_hero.png\" class=\"alignright\" /> Today we will introduce a <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/12/11/ibm-dataworks-on-bluemix/\">new IBM DataWorks</a> service with an improved environment and priced plans.</p>\n<p>We will be deprecating the existing free service at the time of the new IBM DataWorks service launch.

DataWorks empowers Bluemix users to access a variety of data sources both on the cloud and on premises and gives them the ability to shape, combine and wrangle the data using a familiar spreadsheet-like user interface, and deliver it to a wide ecosystem of cloud data services for analysis, visualization, modeling and other analytics tasks.</p>\n<p><!--<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w95VL_tAVLQ?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>--></p>\n<div data-widget=\"videoplayer\" data-videoid=\"w95VL_tAVLQ\" data-videotype=\"youtube\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w95VL_tAVLQ\">Watch the video</a></div>\n<h2>Why DataWorks?</h2>\n<p>Data is the new natural resource that fuels business decision-making, insights and competitive advantage. Cloud, Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are providing vast amounts of new data in a wide variety of formats that businesses need to tap into, along with more traditional systems of record that run today’s business operations.</p>\n<p>However, raw data needs to be refined, cleansed, shaped, formatted and, in general, prepared in order to unlock its true value. Today, business analysts, data scientist and other knowledge workers are spending the majority of their time (between 40 and 80 percent according to Forrester) finding, refining and wrangling data to be used for analytics. Traditional data integration tools require technical skills that are scarce &#8211; and most of the time unavailable &#8211; to fulfill requests for clean and relevant data, leading to weeks, months and sometimes years of delays in analytics project.</p>\n<p>To overcome the current paradigm, where too much time is spent preparing rather than analyzing data, business users must be empowered to self-serve and prepare their data in a fraction of the time and effort required by traditional tools. DataWorks addresses this challenge by providing easy-to-use data preparation and data movement on the cloud, accessible to both technical and non-technical users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dataworks_homepage.png\" alt=\"DataWorks Home Page\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" /></p>\n<h2>Guarantee the Quality and Shape of Your Data</h2>\n<p>With DataWorks, today’s knowledge workers can access hybrid data wherever it is, by leveraging connectivity to the most common and widely used data sources and secure gateway technology to reach into on-premise data, including data that is stored behind enterprise firewalls. Users can access data from multiple sources and combine it to produce more relevant and complete datasets, as well as shape raw data by using automated scores to assess the quality, filter unwanted values, remove columns and sort the data.</p>\n<p>Once the user is satisfied with the shape of the data, they can deliver it to integrated cloud data services like dashDB, Cloudant and Watson Analytics. A shaping recipe is called an activity in DataWorks. Once defined, users can run activities any time to refresh or augment their data. Application developers can also integrate the execution of activities created by analysts and data scientists into application workflows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dataworks_prep_lifecycle.png\" alt=\"Data prep lifecycle\" /></p>\n<p>DataWorks is now available as a beta service to Bluemix subscribers for a limited time. Enterprise customers can reserve subscription packages and benefit from full access to IBM support and the ability to support larger scale data preparation projects. Want to learn more?

Recently, we made some significant updates to the service that dramatically improve the insights (improved analytics capabilities) and the available actions allowing you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a service request in your Enterprise Asset Management system when an asset has an issue</li>\n<li>Notify your sales team when a customer needs new supplies for your product</li>\n<li>Send a text message to personnel and alert your Safety Team when unsafe conditions exist</li>\n<li>Or closer to home, remind yourself when you’ve left the garage door open at night</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These examples are made possible in part through three new actions:  Node-RED, If-This-Then-That (IFTTT), and webhook (a general purpose RESTful service call).  We’ve also made some other enhancements to improve analytics capabilities, ease of use (and reuse), and the user interface for the rules editor.</p>\n<h2>Analytics and actions improvements</h2>\n<p>The new action types allow nearly limitless ways to drive real-time alerts and actions into other systems automatically!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Node-RED action</b> provides an easy way to invoke a Node-RED flow where you can perform additional logic, massage the data, store it or simply send notifications to other systems</li>\n<li><b>IFTTT action</b> enables integration with the IFTTT service where you can easily link to hundreds of other actions from turning the lights on in your house to posting an image snapshot from a security camera to Box</li>\n<li><b>Webhook action</b> is a RESTful service call that can trigger an alert or activity in just about any system through RESTful APIs. For example, creating a service request in Maximo Enterprise Asset Management to investigate an asset that is operating out of normal tolerances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is a summary of other new features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Reusable Actions</b>: You can create actions as separate entities and reuse them with multiple rules.  For example, if you create a Node-RED flow to process the payload from an alert and then send that off to an order management system, you could then use that same action across many rules that monitor inventory levels for hundreds of items</li>\n<li><b>Analytics Enhancements</b>: We’ve also made some general improvements to the analytics rules editor.  The user interface has been updated to be cleaner and a bit more compact allowing more real estate to work with complex conditions and actions.  You can also compare two values in the same message to monitor correlated properties, and you can compare data points to context parameters to apply rules to subsets of devices based on asset ID or location, for example.  Rules also have a severity indicator that is associated with all alerts.  The severity can be used to prioritize the processing of actions and is displayed in the real-time dashboards</li>\n<li><b>Streamlined administration</b>: The administrative task of creating message schemas is now much easier.  Simply connect your device and Real-Time Insights parses the incoming messages and provides a guided path allowing you to select incoming properties and then add friendly names, units, and context descriptors in a few simple steps\n<li><b>Dashboard improvements</b>: Another update to the real-time dashboard allows you to filter alerts for your devices over the last day, week or arbitrary date ranges to help you see just the right level of alert history.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>We&#8217;re listening to you!</h2>\n<p>Our team has been listening to you and we’ve been hard at work delivering these new capabilities which will provide a tremendous amount of flexibility and value, providing you with tools to make your real-time analytics smarter while easily integrating with other systems.</p>\n<p>Log into Bluemix and give these new features in the <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/iot-real-time-insights/\">IoT Real-Time Insights service</a> a try!</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/12/improved-iot-real-time-insights/","date":"2015-12-02T07:00:00","modified":"2016-12-07T16:33:03","format":"standard","slug":"improved-iot-real-time-insights","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=26806","excerpt":"<p>Real-time analytics provide insights from streaming IoT data, but the key is taking the appropriate action as a result of those insights, and IoT Real-Time Insights helps you do both.

Globalization Pipeline also allows for the import of existing translations for developers who wish to leverage their previous investments</li>\n<li>Integrated machine translation with human post-editing capabilities to ensure consistency.  Globalization Pipeline stores the translation in a backend database so that once strings are translated and edited, you don’t need to re-translate unless the source changes. In the Beta release, the service will support English as a source language, plus 9 target languages: French, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Korean</li>\n<li>Plugins to IBM Delivery Pipeline and IBM UrbanCode Deploy to automate the push of new source content to the Globalization Pipeline service for translation</li>\n<li>A comprehensive set of open source SDKs (Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Angular, Ruby, Python, plus an Apache Cordova plugin), that enable app developers to transparently update translations in their applications without having to rebuild or redeploy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, Globalization Pipeline provides Bluemix app developers with an end-to-end solution for automating the translation of their Cloud and Mobile applications. IBM Globalization Pipeline makes it easy for you to provide your global customers with Bluemix applications translated into the languages in which they work.</p>\n<h3>Want to learn more?</h3>\n<p>Check out this video that describes how to get started:</p>\n<p><!--<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTLsxM4WiUE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>--><br />\n<div data-widget=\"videoplayer\" data-videoid=\"pTLsxM4WiUE\" data-videotype=\"youtube\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTLsxM4WiUE\">Watch the video</a></div></p>\n<p>And then look for Globalization Pipeline in the Bluemix catalog under DevOps.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/11/translate-bluemix-apps-using-globalization-pipeline/","date":"2015-11-17T01:00:00","modified":"2016-12-07T16:33:07","format":"standard","slug":"translate-bluemix-apps-using-globalization-pipeline","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=25108","excerpt":"<p>According to a 2014 survey by Common Sense Advisory of more than 3,000 global consumers in 10 non-Anglophone countries in Europe, Asia, and South America, 75% prefer to buy products in their native language.

As a rule of thumb, the cached buildpacks typically only cache two minor versions for each runtime&#8217;s major version. For example, for PHP runtime v5.5.x, only v5.5.29 and v5.5.30 are cached in php_buildpack v4.1.5. Uncached versions of the runtimes are not available to the applications.</p>\n<p>You can find what runtime versions are supported in each buildpack&#8217;s release page (see the links above). Note the best practice of specifying runtime versions for your application is to only specify the major version if possible, for example, node.js v0.12.x, instead of specifying the exact minor version like v0.12.7. This way your application will be much less vulnerable to the changes of cached runtime versions as the buildpacks evolve.</p>\n<p>Below are some major changes in the new buildpack versions that might affect your applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>nodejs_buildpack</b> &#8211; Node.js runtime v0.8.x and v0.9.x have been removed from the cached package. The cached versions are now v0.10.x, v0.11.x and v0.12.x</li>\n<li><b>go_buildpack</b> &#8211; Go runtime v1.1.x has been removed from the cached package, and v1.5.x is added. The cached versions are now v1.2.x, v1.3.x, v1.4.x and v1.5.x</li>\n<li><b>python_buildpack</b> &#8211; Python runtime v3.2.x has been removed from the cached package, and v3.5.x is added. The cached versions are now v2.7.x, v3.3.x, v3.4.x, and v3.5.x</li>\n<li><b>php_buildpack</b> &#8211; There is a breaking change in the composer detection logic.

Last week it was updated once again, this time adding support for creating hybrid XPages applications. This marks an important step for the runtime, since it enables support for a key use case for XPages in Bluemix. A hybrid application in this context is one that combines a front-end Bluemix cloud application, with data stored on an external server. For XPages, this means a Bluemix application using the XPages runtime combined with data NSF(s) hosted on an external private Domino server. The external Domino server could be a standard on-premises server in your own data center, or a server running in a cloud platform like SoftLayer.</p>\n<p>The hybrid model is an important solution for production XPages applications as it allows customers to leverage their existing NSF data and Domino directory from within Bluemix applications using the very latest XPages runtime. Of course the XPages Bluemix application can also leverage the host of available Bluemix services, all in all it represents a real opportunity to truly modernize existing Notes client applications.</p>\n<h2>How to make a hybrid XPages application on Bluemix</h2>\n<p>The video below describes how to create hybrid XPages applications by configuring an XPages Bluemix application to connect with a data NSF on an external Domino server.</p>\n<p><!--<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsjQ4hjJ10E?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>--></p>\n<div data-widget=\"videoplayer\" data-videoid=\"WsjQ4hjJ10E\" data-videotype=\"youtube\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsjQ4hjJ10E\">Watch the video</a></div>\n<h2>Domino Designer tooling enhancements for Bluemix</h2>\n<p>As well as updating the runtime, there are many enhancements to the Bluemix tooling within Domino Designer. These latest updates provide the features you need in order to turn your XPages Bluemix application into a hybrid application. To pick up the tooling changes, head over to <a href=\"http://extlib.openntf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenNTF.org</a> to download release 15 of the XPages Extension Library.</p>\n<p>In essence the latest Domino Designer plug-ins enable you to configure a hybrid application environment. You can specify the details of your hybrid environment as a set of preferences in Domino Designer. Each application you deploy to Bluemix has a deployment profile, which can use the default hybrid integration preferences, or you can modify the hybrid settings on a per application basis.</p>\n<p>To examine the new hybrid settings in Domino Designer select <i>File > Preferences > Domino Designer > IBM Bluemix > Hybrid Integration Detail</i>. For a given application you can apply these settings using a new hybrid configuration option in the Bluemix Manifest Editor. It will bring up a dialog window that lets you load and modify the necessary settings for a hybrid application (the IP address has been obsured in the image below). The dialog is shown below along with a full explanation of all the new settings:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hybrid1_resized.jpg\" /></p>\n<h2>New environment variables used by XPages on Bluemix</h2>\n<p>The settings specified in the dialog above will apply a number of environment variables in the manifest file of your application. These environment variables will be used by the XPages runtime when your application is being started on Bluemix to configure your hybrid application.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that when running an XPages Bluemix application there are really two Domino servers involved – although that may not be initially obvious. One Domino server is used to serve up the actual data – this is referred to as the remote server below. The other Domino server is the XPages Runtime, a lightweight Domino application server that Bluemix stands up to actually run your XPages application – this is what’s referred to as the runtime server. With that in mind, the following details should make perfect sense in the context of a hybrid application. Each bullet point describes the name of a setting, the associated environment variable name, and a description of that setting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Remote Server Address</b> &#8211; <code>APP_REMOTE_DATA_SERVER_ADDRESS</code> &#8211; Specifies the IP address of the desired remote data server (for example, 111.222.33.44).</li>\n<li><b>Remote Server Name</b> &#8211; <code>APP_REMOTE_DATA_SERVER_NAME</code> &#8211; Specifies the name of the desired remote data server (for example, onpremise/greenwell).</li>\n<li><b>Runtime Server Name</b> &#8211; <code>APP_RUNTIME_SERVER_NAME</code> &#8211; Specifies the name to apply to the runtime application container server (for example, xpagesruntime/greenwell). In most cases the domain part of this setting &#8220;/greenwell&#8221; should match the domain of the remote server name setting.</li>\n<li><b>Runtime Server ID File</b> &#8211; <code>APP_RUNTIME_SERVER_IDFILE</code> &#8211; Specifies the location of the ID file that will be used during application staging (for example, C:\\IBM\\Notes\\Data\\ids\\servers\\runtime-server.id). This is a server ID file created by your remote server, an ID that is trusted by the remote server to access it. See the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/xpages/index.html#xpruntime_hybrid_create_id\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> for more details on how to create such an ID. This ID will be pushed up with your application when you deploy it to Bluemix. It is a key part of establishing a trusted, encrypted, secure connection between the XPages application in Bluemix and the remote data server.</li>\n<li><b>Runtime Server ID Password</b> &#8211; <code>APP_RUNTIME_SERVER_PASSWORD</code> &#8211; Specifies the password of the server ID.</li>\n<li><b>Directory Assistance Enabled</b> &#8211; <code>APP_DA_ENABLED</code> &#8211; Specifies whether ID directory assistance has been enabled for your hybrid configuration.</li>\n<li><b>Directory Assistance Domain</b> &#8211; <code>APP_DA_DOMAIN</code> &#8211; Specifies the domain name of the data server (for example, &#8220;greenwell&#8221; in the settings above).</li>\n<li><b>Directory Assistance Address Book </b>&#8211; <code>APP_DA_ADDRESS_BOOK</code> &#8211; Specifies the domain directory NSF filename needed for authentication in your hybrid application configuration (for example, &#8220;names.nsf&#8221;).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on how to make a hybrid XPages application, consult the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/xpages/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation for the XPages runtime</a>.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/11/hybrid-xpages-applications-on-bluemix/","date":"2015-11-10T03:00:20","modified":"2016-12-07T16:33:09","format":"standard","slug":"hybrid-xpages-applications-on-bluemix","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=25872","excerpt":"<p>Last week the XPages service added support for creating hybrid XPages applications.

In the past the Bluemix ASP.NET 5 boilerplates were, for example, targeting &#8220;dnx451&#8221;. Now they need to target &#8220;dnxcore50&#8221;. Their project.json files have the following section:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&lt;code&gt;&quot;frameworks&quot;: { \r\n    &quot;dnxcore50&quot;: { }\r\n}&lt;/code&gt;</pre>\n<p>Also the <a href=\"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/milestones/1.0.0-beta8\" target=\"_blank\">release announcements</a> lists breaking ASP.NET 5 changes you may encounter.</p>\n<p><b>Other buildpack improvements</b></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/DNX-utility#publish-dnu-publish\" target=\"_blank\">dnu publish</a> command will package an application into a self-contained directory which can optionally even include the runtime.</p>\n<p>The buildpack will now recognize published applications and skip restoring packages. If the runtime is present, it will also skip downloading it. Simply change to the bin/output directory that is created and push the application from there. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&lt;code&gt;$ dnu publish\r\n$ cd bin/output\r\n$ cf push myapp&lt;/code&gt;</pre>\n<p>This is not a performance improvement. It is generally much slower to upload all the application dependencies than it is to download them while the application is staging in Bluemix.

In fact, interest in Docker container technology has been rapidly spreading across Europe with an active, vibrant Docker community.  On <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/community\">Docker&#8217;s Community web page</a>, there are Meetup groups listed for over 80 cities in Europe – from Pisa, Italy to Krakow, Poland.</p>\n<p>The benefits of containers are well documented and these have not gone unnoticed by European businesses. Containers give software developers a way to package an application with all of its dependencies into a ‘container’ that can be deployed and run the same regardless of the underlying environment.  This application portability enables developers to ship software more frequently because they don’t have to spend time setting up and troubleshooting different environments across the dev/test pipeline. Containers are also very lightweight, making efficient use of the resources they run on.</p>\n<h2>Announcing Docker Trusted Registry for Europe</h2>\n<p>Although the large, open source community is the driving force behind the rapid adoption of Docker containers, many customers want the security and peace of mind of a commercially-supported solution.  With an open source solution, the onus is on the end user to file and lobby for code fixes. On the other hand, a commercially-supported solution allows you to focus on your application and let Docker handle the bug fixes. With this in mind, <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/videos/ibm-and-docker-partnership/\">Docker partnered with IBM</a> to launch their first commercial offering &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry\">Docker Trusted Registry</a> with commercially supported Docker Engines &#8211; in <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47165.wss\">June of this year</a> with availability in North America only.  This offering is <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/1/877/ENUSZP15-0561/index.html&#038;lang=en&#038;request_locale=en\">now available in Europe</a> for businesses looking for a commercially supported Docker solution.</p>\n<p><b>Production-Ready Containers</b>: Docker Trusted Registry brings the wildly popular open source Docker on premises for customers who want the added security and control of a production ready solution.  What makes it production ready? In addition to formal support from IBM and Docker, Docker Trusted Registry provides clients with a private registry behind the firewall, security and compliance capabilities to manage access control, and integration with existing directories such as LDAP and Active Directory. It also comes with a user interface for administrators to monitor the health of the registry.</p>\n<p><b>Docker and DevOps Tools</b>: Docker Trusted Registry is a great complement to commercial tools for DevOps, such as <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/\">IBM UrbanCode</a>.  This enables developers, as part of their continuous integration and delivery software pipeline, to coordinate and automate the deployment of multi-container Docker application environments to the different stages of the delivery pipeline, as well as manage promotions, approvals and inventories. The end result is faster and more reliable software delivery.</p>\n<p><b>Hosted cloud environment in Europe</b>: For those customers who are interested in running their Docker containers in a hosted cloud environment in Europe, IBM recently announced <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/09/30/ibm-containers-launch-london/\">their first Docker-based hosted container service available in Bluemix UK</a>.   The availability of IBM Containers in London mitigates many users’ concerns regarding securing their data within the European Union.  In addition to the Docker capabilities themselves, users also benefit from the IBM Containers capabilities including enterprise-ready images, the security readiness guidance of the Vulnerability Advisor, integrated logging and monitoring, binding to the 120+ Bluemix services and many more unique features.</p>\n<h2>Get started today</h2>\n<p>To learn more about production ready containers from IBM and Docker, visit the <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/IBM\">IBM and Docker resource center</a>.

The v2.1 buildpack provides a couple of important performance improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>App Management utilities:</b> In June, we introduced <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/06/16/liberty-buildpack-app-management-support/\">an enhanced app management support</a>: a collection of utilities that provide development and debug functionality to Liberty applications running in Bluemix. Two of those utilities &#8211; <code>devconsole</code> and <code>shell</code> &#8211; provide a nice web-based interface. The web interfaces pull in a large of set of dependencies that consume a lot of disk space and can take a while to install and start. In the new buildpack, we have optimized the <code>devconsole</code> and <code>shell</code> utilities to reduce the disk, install and start time overhead. With these optimizations, we also have reduced the droplet size and decreased the overall time it takes to deploy a Liberty application to Bluemix!<br />\nIn order to maximize these improvements, the <code>shell</code> and <code>devconsole</code> utilities now require a <b>restage</b> operation instead of <i>restart</i> to enable them. For example, to enable both utilities for your application execute:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$ cf se myApp BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_ENABLE devconsole+shell\r\n$ cf restage myApp\r\n</pre>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/app_management.html\">App Management</a> documentation for further details.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>CDI 1.2 annotation scanning:</b> By default, when deploying a WAR or EAR file to Bluemix, the buildpack will automatically enable <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/09/18/liberty-buildpack-v2/\">Java EE 7 Web Profile Liberty features</a> for the application. One of those features is <a href=\"http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=cord&#038;product=was-nd-mp&#038;topic=rwlp_feature_cdi-1.2\">cdi-1.2</a> feature. The Contexts and Dependency Injection 1.1/1.2 specification introduced the concept of <a href=\"http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=cord&#038;product=was-nd-mp&#038;topic=cwlp_cdi_behavior\">implicit bean archives</a> &#8211; archives that are without the <code>beans.xml</code> file and contain CDI annotated classes. With the <code>cdi-1.2</code> feature enabled, such archives must be scanned for annotations. In case of large applications with a number of library files, the annotation scanning can take a long time to complete and significantly increase the application start up time. For this reason, the annotation scanning of the implicit archives is disabled by default for WAR and EAR files. If needed, the implicit bean archive scanning can be enabled for an application using the <code>JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY</code> environment variable. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$ cf se myApp JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY &quot;app_archive: { implicit_cdi: true }&quot;\r\n$ cf restage myApp\r\n</pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the performance improvements, the buildpack contains an updated version of Liberty profile based on the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2015/09/25/beta-was-liberty-beta-with-tools-october-2015/\">October beta</a>. With this update, the <code>bells-1.0</code>, <code>rtcomm-1.0</code>, <code>rtcommGateway-1.0</code>, <code>samlWeb-2.0</code>, and <code>sipServlet-1.1</code> Liberty features, previously available as beta features, are now available as production-ready features. The buildpack also has an updated IBM JRE 8 SR1 FP11.</p>\n<p><b>Reminder</b></p>\n<p>If your application is deployed with the <code>liberty-for-java-v1</code> buildpack, please make sure to <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/09/18/liberty-buildpack-v2/\">move to the new v2 buildpack</a> as the v1 buildpack will be deleted soon.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/10/performance-improvements-liberty-buildpack-v21/","date":"2015-10-19T16:13:37","modified":"2017-01-11T07:02:30","format":"standard","slug":"performance-improvements-liberty-buildpack-v21","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=24386","excerpt":"<p>Today, we have released a new version of the Liberty buildpack.

The Message Hub:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provides Messaging for Bluemix services</li>\n<li>enables developers to build apps in a microservices framework</li>\n<li>streams data to analytics engines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Message Hub is a scalable, distributed, high throughput message bus that unites your Cloud applications.

Kafka is ideal for large scale message processing, and provides resiliency, high throughput, built-in partitioning, replication and fault-tolerance.</p>\n<p>Using the Kafka REST API you are able to produce messages and create consumers. For more flexibility and performance you can use a Kafka client. Message Hub is based on Kafka 0.9 which brings TLS-secured connections for clients, so the earlier high-level consumer cannot be used. The newer Kafka 0.9 consumer is the way to go.</p>\n<p>You can use any language that supports HTTPS to interact with the Message Hub Kafka interface. This allows developers to work in a variety of different languages for different microservices, rather than having to learn something new or choose a language that may not be best suited for their application.</p>\n<h3>Provides wiring for Microservices</h3>\n<p>Message Hub is ideal for building apps in a microservices architecture. A microservices framework requires that applications are scalable and loosely coupled.   Message Hub allows you to create connections and tie different services together.</p>\n<p>Message Hub makes it easy to combine microservices, by emitting and consuming events. Event driven applications can be designed by streaming the data from microservices to analytics services within Bluemix.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wiringForMicroservices_250x170.png\" /> <img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ConnectingBluemixServicesMariposa_250x170.png\" alt=\"ConnectingBluemixServicesMariposa_250x170\" /></p>\n<p>With microservices it is easy for developers to scale apps and deploy changes to the individual microservices without the need to recycle the entire application for every minor change.  An existing monolithic application may be decomposed into smaller functional units (microservices) which are wired together, yet may be updated and scaled independently.</p>\n<h3>Part of Bluemix</h3>\n<p>Bluemix is designed to make developers&#8217; lives easier. Dev teams of all sizes can seamlessly collaborate on source code and shared APIs, and manage application performance, logs and costs from a single dashboard. Message Hub brings Kafka messaging to the Bluemix platform, allowing you to extend the functionality of your apps. A major benefit of deploying microservices in the Bluemix cloud is that you are able to scale when necessary and exploit the elasticity the cloud offers.</p>\n<h3>Stream data for analytics and create event driven applications</h3>\n<p>Using the IBM Message Hub, you can feed event data to multiple applications so they can react in real time.

Cleversafe helps clients manage their storage costs while providing high availability, reliability and storage-at-scale for their data content.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cleversafe_logo.png\" /></p>\n<p><em>Thoughts on Cloud</em> spoke with Riz Amanuddin, IBM Offering Manager for Cloud Object Storage Services:</p>\n<p><b>What can you tell us about Cleversafe’s current customer base?</b></p>\n<p>Cleversafe serves a number of industry verticals, including media/entertainment, financial, government and retail/commerce. The Cleversafe solution provides cross-industry flexibility, and they have traction across several key industries. In these segments, Cleversafe’s track record of implementations and best practices brings value to vertical markets.</p>\n<p>Cleversafe’s customer base today includes enterprises, service providers and governments. Their solutions help customers retain, access, and manage large amounts of data.</p>\n<p><b>Where does IBM see Cleversafe fitting in with its cloud strategy?</b></p>\n<p>Once the acquisition closes, IBM sees Cleversafe as an integral part of the hybrid cloud and object storage offering strategy. Cleversafe adds leading-edge object storage innovation to IBM Object Storage offerings, extending and enhancing object storage capabilities. Once closed, the Cleversafe acquisition will allow IBM to provide flexible deployment support for on-premises, hybrid, private and public cloud deployments to help meet our clients’ business data needs.</p>\n<p>As an example, a hybrid implementation would support a multi-site model with on-premises and off-premises storage capabilities, facilitating off-premises storage scalability in response to data demand.</p>\n<p>Cleversafe provides a core technology that can be leveraged by IBM’s cloud and systems storage portfolio, helping to evolve IBM’s object storage offerings to a broad range of capabilities, including high capacity and data at scale.</p>\n<p><b>What prompted IBM’s move to acquire an object storage company? Are you seeing an increasing demand in this area?</b></p>\n<p>Because data storage is a lynchpin for applications and services, Cleversafe’s object storage capabilities can help enable IBM to embrace growth in data content in a cost-effective manner. This is especially relevant given the amount of data for mobile, social, cloud, analytics and data storage for archive, business continuity and retention.</p>\n<p><b>Why Cleversafe?</b></p>\n<p>Cleversafe has a strong technology platform and experience with large scale deployments.  Cleversafe’s flagship product, Dispersed Storage Network (dsNet)®, provides a highly scalable Object Store platform for large production deployment and can address PBs of storage at scale. The technology provides the ability to manage massive amounts of objects with durability and cost efficiency, helping to complement IBM products and storage offerings.</p>\n<p>Cleversafe’s key technology features address storage management and integration that IBM clients demand. Cleversafe supports compatibility with a common set of object storage industry standard APIs. These include OpenStack Swift with Cleversafe object layer architecture. Cleversafe also supports integration with identity management, including LDAP and OpenStack Keystone. The dsNET platform supports a global name space and offers configurable erasure coding capability.</p>\n<p><b>So, would you say Cleversafe is readymade for IBM’s existing clients?</b></p>\n<p>Yes.

No, they should be using a service or services. Heck, they probably shouldn’t be writing any server side code at all, right?</p>\n<p>So true to lean, we stood up a set of mobile backend services that did three out of four &#8211; Authentication, Data persistence and Push notifications.</p>\n<p>We learned a lot while we were building these services &#8211; it was our first foray into delivering services on the Bluemix PaaS. After we delivered our first generation, we were left with the age old question &#8211; make these better? Or toss them and write new ones?</p>\n<p>We opted to write new ones, and roll them in phases. We’d leave our first generation out there as we built out the new services across platforms. We started with a focused set of services for iOS 8 and add the fourth core capability &#8211; analytics. We would also make all of these services secure and available at the click of a button. These new services went live in January of 2015, and on September 16th we added support for iOS9. Today I’m happy to announce that we are adding Android to our second generation of mobile cloud services.</p>\n<h2>Open by design</h2>\n<p>Our Android story has another exciting aspect &#8211; we developed the <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services\">Android SDK’s for these services in GiThub</a>, open from day one of development &#8211; open by design. Our development team got to perform the coveted ‘file->new’ for the Android project, and have been happily committing ever since.</p>\n<p>The Android SDK is the first in many that you can expect to see open in the coming year &#8211; we truly believe that there is an amazing strength in the developer community, and that opening the code opens the door to contributions, communication, and the opportunity to learn from each other.</p>\n<p>Another thing that you can look forward to doing is using our second generation IBM Push Notifications service as a standalone service. We’ve removed dependencies that Push previously had on other services, so it can now operate independently. The Push service was also built with Swagger APIs, so you can use our SDK, or you can directly access the rest APIs.</p>\n<p>Our second generation of services – IBM Mobile Client Access, IBM Push Notifications, and Cloudant NoSQLDB – are ready and waiting for you to try them out. We’ve made it easier than ever to get started. You’ll still see our first generation – Mobile Application Security, Push, and Mobile Data – in the catalog for a bit, but we highly recommend starting with the second gen.</p>\n<p>If you’ve already been using our second generation, you’ll see some instructions on how to get setup when you go to the service dashboards.</p>\n<h2>Just the beginning</h2>\n<p>Here in IBM MobileFirst Platform, we are just at the beginning of our Bluemix adventure, and we look forward to continuously improving the way you develop mobile applications.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about these and other services available for mobile <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/solutions/mobilefirst/\">here</a>.

This is especially true for enterprises with sensitive data and workloads that must remain on-premises in order to address key security and compliance requirements.</p>\n<p>The core challenge that many companies are finding around on-premises cloud&mdash;particularly when it comes to platforms&mdash;is an inability to successfully balance cost, agility and quality of service. Given the rapid pace of innovation and change in the industry, many enterprises also want to ensure that entry points into cloud are coupled with clear paths to a more expansive cloud strategy &#8211; a strategy that will almost inevitably include a mixture of on and off-premises infrastructure and services.</p>\n<p>To help address these challenges, today we are thrilled to round out the foundation of our approach to <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/hybrid/\">hybrid cloud</a> with the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/hybrid/local/\">introduction of Bluemix Local</a>.</p>\n<p><!-- \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Introducing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bluemix?src=hash\">#Bluemix</a> Local &amp; a new approach to cloud services in the data center. <a href=\"https://t.co/ljuTeLb3JL\">https://t.co/ljuTeLb3JL</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/NG8Mm95Fom\">pic.twitter.com/NG8Mm95Fom</a></p>\n\n&mdash; IBM Bluemix™ (@IBMBluemix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IBMBluemix/status/649570433805586432\">October 1, 2015</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> --></p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/hybrid/\" target=\"_blank\">Interested in learning more? Contact us</a></p>\n<h2>Operating your own on-premises cloud platform is complex</h2>\n<p>While many enterprise customers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in the way they deliver IaaS, anything on top of that is still a real challenge.</p>\n<p>At the platform layer you are no longer responsible for only compute, networking and storage – but runtimes, databases, analytics, integration and security services, developer and operations tools and the list goes on.  And these services are now brought to market on a development cycle built around continuous innovation and delivery.</p>\n<p>This confluence introduces truly substantial operational challenges to take advantage of cloud platforms and services in a reliable, cost-effective way.</p>\n<h2>Public as the first step toward Local</h2>\n<p>We have been operating the Bluemix public cloud deployment for over 18 months and are thrilled it has grown to over 120 services and now welcomes over 15,000 new users a week.  That experience has helped us develop unique expertise&mdash;especially around the new, core open source components like Cloud Foundry, Docker &amp; OpenStack&mdash;associated with operations, delivery, scalability, performance, HA and more.</p>\n<p>That expertise&mdash;combined with a lot of automation&mdash;is what makes Bluemix Local possible.</p>\n<h2>Bluemix Local is a cloud service delivered via Relay</h2>\n<p>We are delivering Bluemix Local as-a-service and through a model centered around ongoing collaboration with your IT team.  It is an approach that will enable your IT and application development teams to take advantage of the cloud&mdash;of new services, features and updates to open source &mdash;and do so in a way that doesn&#8217;t involve building a new DevOps organization.</p>\n<h3>Relay is what makes it possible</h3>\n<p>Relay is a new delivery mechanism for on-premises cloud that enables us to help keep your Bluemix Local deployment healthy and up-to-date. New platform updates are run through a consistent testing and validation process that involves initially pushing code to our staging environments, then our own internal Bluemix deployment, then to our public and dedicated environments.</p>\n<p>The final stage of that journey is that these updates are relayed into your local cloud leveraging our secure CI/CD pipeline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/how-it-works.jpg\" alt=\"Bluemix Local - how it works\" /></p>\n<p>These updates are then made available in your Admin Console and you can then easily control your maintenance window and apply windows of time when you are most comfortable bringing those updates into your environment.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/relay.gif\" alt=\"Relay in Action\" /></center></p>\n<h2>One experience across all of Bluemix</h2>\n<p>Because all of Bluemix is operated through a single, consistent update and release process, the core fabric across every environment is identical.  This characteristic provides teams with tremendous flexibility to easily move apps and services from local into public or dedicated over time.</p>\n<p>All Bluemix deployment models are also bound together by a single admin console and services catalog.</p>\n<p><strong>Admin console</strong><br /> <img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/admin-console-small.png\" alt=\"The Bluemix Admin Console\" class=\"alignright\" /> Across your entire Bluemix environment, the admin console enables your team to control timing around incoming platform updates, approve and manage access to services, onboard users, view and manage quota by orgs and deep dive into system information, logs and reports.</p>\n<p><strong>Syndicated catalog</strong><br /> <img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/syndicated-catalog-small.png\" alt=\"Bluemix Syndicated Catalog\" class=\"alignright\" /> Through our approach to catalog syndication, your development teams get access to a single view services (including custom/your own) that includes local services and any services you approve from the public catalog.  This enables your development teams to <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/10/01/creating-hybrid-apps-on-bluemix/\">optimize composite apps</a> by locating individual services within the deployment model that best suits specific needs around elasticity, security, cost and performance.</p>\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/hybrid/\" target=\"_blank\">Ready to explore hybrid solutions? Contact us</a></p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>The pricing for Bluemix Local is based on a subscription and allocation model.  You have one monthly bill and it is driven by the size of your environment you’d like to create.</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s only the beginning</h2>\n<p>Today, Bluemix Local is shipping with Cloud Foundry based runtimes, catalog syndication, data cache and API Management.  And this is only the beginning.  We delivered over 120 services in our public cloud over the last 18 months and will bring that same pace of innovation and delivery to local as well.</p>\n<p>And when new services are available, quickly taking advantage of them will be easier than ever before.  Because they will simply come in over Relay.</p>\n<p>We hope that you&#8217;re as excited about Bluemix Local as we are and if you&#8217;d like to learn we encourage you to <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/hybrid/local/\">check out our website</a> and contact us for more information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/hybrid/local/\">Experience the power of the cloud behind the firewall</a> (IBM)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-advances-hybrid-cloud-capabilities-unveils-bluemix-local-300152563.html\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Advances Hybrid Cloud Capabilities; Unveils Bluemix Local</a> (PR Newswire)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/01/ibm-bluemix-local/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM puts Bluemix everywhere</a> (Fortune)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2988357/ibm-brings-bluemix-behind-the-firewall-for-sensitive-workloads.html\">IBM brings Bluemix behind the firewall for sensitive workloads</a> (CIO)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-launches-bluemix-local-aims-to-bridge-public-private-clouds-with-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM launches Bluemix Local, bridges public, private clouds with data center</a> (ZDNet)</li>\n<li><a href-\"http://www.enterprisetech.com/2015/10/01/ibm-expands-bluemix-with-local-security/\">IBM Expands Bluemix With ‘Local’ Security</a> (EnterpriseTech)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/2887559/ibm-brings-bluemix-platform-services-inhouse.html\" target=\"_blank\">IBM brings BlueMix platform services in-house</a> (Computerworld)\n</ul>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/10/introducing-bluemix-local-relay/","date":"2015-10-01T07:54:06","modified":"2016-12-07T16:25:10","format":"standard","slug":"introducing-bluemix-local-relay","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=23266","excerpt":"<p>We have been operating the Bluemix public cloud deployment for over 18 months and are thrilled it has grown to over 120 services and now welcomes over 15,000 new users a week.

The Watson platform is now the largest and most diverse set of cognitive APIs, technologies and tools available to developers for creating innovative applications or enhancing existing solutions.</p>\n<p>Today we are announcing the release of new and enhanced Watson cognitive services across four areas: Language, Vision, Speech and Data Insights. These services use advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning approaches to enable new opportunities to understand and engage users, and leverage the massive growth of unstructured data in multiple formats: text, speech, photos and videos.</p>\n<p>Watson services break down the barriers to analyzing unstructured data with powerful cognitive capabilities available to all. With the release of these services, we are addressing needs expressed by individual developers, startups, and large enterprises. We have been guided by the feedback and usage patterns of our 77,000+ active developers, and over 350 partners (with 100 in market today) across 17 industries. They are moving forward on bold ideas made possible with Watson.  </p>\n<h2>Introducing the new IBM Watson service releases and enhancements</h2>\n<p>Several services released in General Availability (GA) enable you to “bring your own data,” and train the service to address the unique needs of an industry, an enterprise, or even a startup pursuing a specialized use case.</p>\n<h3>General Availability services:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/nl-classifier.html\"><strong>Natural Language Classifier</strong></a> mimics the human ability to classify naturally expressed short phrases into categories, or classes.

As increased customer demands are placed on our infrastructure, new processes are created to handle the load dynamically using proxy to create a seamless experience for the customer. This new design not only provides better scalability, but also increases the high availability within a given node for any given process that appears slow or non-responsive.</p>\n<h4>Manually Horizontal Scalability and High Availability</h4>\n<p>Though Dynamic Vertical Scalability provides a major portion of increased scalability, the new design also required cross-node changes that provide for better management of Secure Gateway&#8217;s High Availability solution. Now with Dynamic Scalability on every node new cross-node handshaking and other architecture changes provide for increased horizontal scaling and better high availability across the entire solution. Additional nodes can be manually added as load increases, providing transparent scaling and increased high availability across the solution.</p>\n<h3>Private Destinations</h3>\n<p>A long standing requirement to provide a mechanism to isolate any particular destination from unwanted public attack is now realized in Version 1.3.0. In this release you can now create private destinations that are restricted to only those access definitions on the cloud side that you provide. By selecting this advanced option you can now create a totally private destination restricted to only cloud side access by your cloud application. Creation is as easy as selecting the option and providing the appropriate IP address or address range and port or port range, as shown by the example screenshot below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/privatedestination2_resized.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" /></p>\n<h3>Client Separation of Duties</h3>\n<p>Separation of duties, the definition of clear boundaries on what tasks are done by whom, moves a step closer in this new release. This support includes but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Access Control List (ACL) is automatically set to ACL DENY ALL\n<li>Native installers which can be installed by a clearly defined administration role\n</ul>\n<p>In Version 1.3.0, the client starts up automatically restricting access to on-premises resources. You must specify an ACL file containing the access control list entries to use or interactively enter them so that access is granted or denied to your on-premises resources. Until this is done all access to on-premises resources are prevented or denied.</p>\n<h4>Docker Client Updates</h4>\n<p>The Secure Gateway Docker client has been updated for 1.3.0 and should be re-pulled to get the latest version. This includes important security updates and fixes, as well as the new client functions.</p>\n<h4>New Client Function</h4>\n<p>This new version of the Secure Gateway Client introduces new behaviors to some existing functions, these are as follows:</p>\n<h5>Access Control List Behavior Changes</h5>\n<p>When the Secure Gateway Client for this new version starts, the Access Control List (ACL) is automatically set to ACL DENY ALL. This means the user must either specify an ACL file containing the access control list entries to use, or interactively enter ACL commands to allow access. <em>Until this is done all access to on-premises resources is prevented.</em></p>\n<h5>New Secure Gateway Client commands</h5>\n<p>In Secure Gateway Client version 1.3.0 two new commands are introduced. One to list the client&#8217;s configuration and another to show the current ACL settings in table format.<br />\nTo view a client&#8217;s configuration once it is connected to the Bluemix Secure Gateway service, you can now use the <code>displayconfig</code> command or shortcut key &#8216;C&#8217;, as shown in the example below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SecGW3_resized.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" /></p>\n<p>To view a client&#8217;s Access Control List (ACL) once you have loaded a file containing them or entered them interactively, you can now use the updated and existing <code>show acl</code> command or shortcut key &#8216;S&#8217;. Now instead of printing out one message for each setting a table is presented to the user with all the settings entered:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SecGW4_resized.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" /></p>\n<h3>Dedicated Support</h3>\n<p>For those customers with interest, Secure Gateway now supports full dedicated cloud support. For those who have purchased a dedicated service agreement and installation with IBM Bluemix, they can now add Secure Gateway to the services they wish to use. All the features they currently have access to in the public Bluemix environment for Secure Gateway are also there in dedicated, it&#8217;s just more private and secure.</p>\n<h3>Native Installers for Secure Gateway Client</h3>\n<p>Beginning with version 1.3.0, the Secure Gateway client provides native client installation support for selected Linux environments. A native running client can improve over-all performance on both bare metal and virtual environments. You can run the natively installed client by using the system auto-start facility or manually by using a terminal session. When you use the auto-start facility, the client automatically logs events to the defined /var/log directory and file.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Versions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ubuntu Linux</td>\n<td>14.04 (LTS) and greater</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Red Hat Linux</td>\n<td>6.5 and greater</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SuSE Linux</td>\n<td>11.0 and greater</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The native installer option is available when you create a new Secure Gateway. After you have entered the name for your new Secure Gateway you are given the client option to select, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SecGW5_resized.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" /></p>\n<p>Currently there are two options for the supported platforms, a DEBIAN and an RPM installer, under the Software Installers section.</p>\n<h3>Secure Gateway SDK Language Bindings</h3>\n<p>The Secure Gateway SDK Language Bindings are now available as open source.

src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/streaming_analytics_200x200.png\" class=\"alignright\" /> We have updated the <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/07/29/ibm-streaming-analytics-now-available-bluemix/\">Streaming Analytics service in Bluemix</a> on September 17th.  This post describes the enhancements included in this beta refresh.</p>\n<p>Current users of the service do not have to perform any actions to pick up the update, but instances of the service were stopped during the refresh, resulting in the cancellation of any running jobs.  You will need to start your instance from the service dashboard (or using the REST API) before you can submit jobs to your instance.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade to Streams 4.0.1</h2>\n<p>The update has upgraded the underlying IBM Streams product from version 4.0.0 to version 4.0.1.  Version 4.0.1 contain fixes as well as some enhancements, including an upgraded Java version.  IBM SDK Java Technology Edition Version 8 is now installed with Streams.  See the <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCRJU_4.0.1/com.ibm.streams.welcome.doc/doc/ibminfospherestreams-whats-new.html\">Streams 4.0.1 Knowledge Center</a> for more details about what&#8217;s new in Streams 4.0.1.</p>\n<p>If you use a Streams 4.0.0 development environment to create your cloud applications, your applications should still deploy to the Streaming Analytics service which is now based upon Streams 4.0.1.</p>\n<h2>Streams Console Enhancements</h2>\n<p>The web console that you can launch from the Streaming Analytics service has also been updated.  This new version of the console contains many improvements, based on user feedback, as well as a number of fixes.  The console provides more information, supports new tasks, and is easier to customize than the prior version.  Below is a screenshot of the updated console</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Con7-1024x350.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>To access the updated console, you’ll want to force a cache refresh in your browser window from the console tab (e.g. Shift-Reload or Ctrl-F5) to make sure the new version of the console is fully loaded.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback on the console design and capabilities, we would like to hear from you!  Please post your feedback to the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/streaming-analytics.html\">Bluemix Streaming Analytics forum</a> and we will consider your suggestions for a future refresh of the service.</p>\n<h2>New Starter Application</h2>\n<p>A new starter application is provided, written in Node.js.  Please visit the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hub.jazz.net/project/streamscloud/EventDetection/overview\">EventDetection</a> project in Bluemix DevOps Services for information about how to download and run the new starter application.  The EventDetection application uses the Streaming Analytics service to detect complex events in a stream of weather data.  The new starter application complements our other starter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hub.jazz.net/project/streamscloud/NYCTraffic/overview\">NYCTraffic</a>, which is written using the Liberty for Java runtime in Bluemix.</p>\n<h2>Additional Integration with Other Bluemix Services</h2>\n<p>Many Bluemix services provide a REST API.  The Streams Inet toolkit has been enhanced to better enable your Streams application to act as a REST client and interact with other Bluemix services.  <strong>Please note:</strong> in order to obtain this enhanced toolkit, you&#8217;ll need to download the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.inet\">latest Inet toolkit</a> and add it to your Streams development environment.  See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/integrating-with-cloudant-and-many-other-restful-services/\">Integrating with Cloudant and many other RESTful Services</a> for a brief tutorial about integrating your Streams application with other services that support a REST API.</p>\n<h2>Credential Support for Unbound Service Instances</h2>\n<p>In response to user requests, service credentials are now automatically created for service instances not bound to a Bluemix application.  The Streaming Analytics service dashboard allows you to view and manage these service credentials by selecting the &#8220;Service Credentials&#8221; item in the left hand navigation area. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/streaming_analytics_credentials.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" /></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the new features of the service.  We encourage you to post your feedback on the service to the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/streaming-analytics.html\">Bluemix Streaming Analytics forum</a> and we will consider your suggestions for a future update.  If you haven&#8217;t used the Streaming Analytics service yet, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streaming-analytics-now-available-bluemix/\">sign up for the Streaming Analytics Service

My go-to devices are my iPhone and iPad. These, and all the applications on them, keep me on time, on course, and engaged with my family, my clients and my IBM team.</p>\n<p>As you may recall, the IBM MobileFirst team is working with Apple to deliver best-in-class iOS enterprise apps. These mobile apps major on simplicity and exceptional end-to-end experience for the user, but behind the scenes they can be quite complex. It’s not uncommon for mobile apps to have many application programming interfaces, or APIs, that connect to a variety of enterprise and cloud services. When you think of the explosive growth of mobile, IoT, and web apps, the number of APIs becomes staggering.</p>\n<p>As enterprises strive to create new business models and deliver truly engaging customer experiences, APIs provide an efficient way to connect front-end mobile and web applications to your treasure trove of customer data and business logic. Node.js has emerged as one of the leading frameworks for APIs, and JavaScript is the top-ranked language, closely followed by Java, according to the June 2015 Redmonk Programming Language Rankings.</p>\n<p>With this acquisition, IBM adds additional Node.js capabilities from StrongLoop to its existing Java, JavaScript and .Net capabilities as a one-stop shop for integration developers. Today, we launch StrongLoop ARC services integrated on IBM Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform for innovation. IBM is also integrating StrongLoop Node.js with our WebSphere, DataPower, API Management and MobileFirst offerings.</p>\n<p><i style=\"font-size: 110%\">Open by design</i></p>\n<p>And all of these efforts are open by design with a strong commitment to the developer ecosystem. Like IBM, StrongLoop is a Node.js Foundation founder, bringing the technology into full open governance so enterprises can use Node.js with confidence. StrongLoop is also a dedicated contributor to Node.js, and it maintains more than 160 modules within Node Package Manager. Together, IBM will continue to promote, support and invest in this open community as it tackles new challenges.

With StrongLoop and IBM together, I have a message for the players in the API Economy… “You are about to experience Hyper-growth!” I predict that over the next 3 years we will see the creation of an additional <i>1 Million Business APIs</i> which will supercharge the economy around APIs.</p>\n<p>You see, no one company can fuel and economy.   This is where I love what the StrongLoop team has done.    They have figured out how to harness the power of communities.   Specifically, these large and vibrant development communities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js</a> &mdash; Server-side Javascript</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Express</a> &mdash; Minimal, yet powerful web framework</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://loopback.io/\" target=\"_blank\">LoopBack</a> &mdash; Quickly create and connect RESTful APIs</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://swagger.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Swagger</a> &mdash; Simple yet powerful representation of RESTful API</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nodered.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Node-RED</a> &mdash; A visual wiring tool for API assembly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are said to be over 11 million Javascript programmers around the globe, with these specific communities playing host to an estimated 100,000+ developers.  The technologies represented by these community projects form the foundation of an Open API platform.    This platform enables developers to rapidly experiment with APIs, rapidly iterating from a concept in a sandbox to production.   I call this method “The StrongLoop Method” of open API design.  The method is simple, yet powerful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Zaharias_method.png\" /></p>\n<p>The StrongLoop Method allows you to start simple; design, test, expand, iterate…<br />\nuntil perfection&#8230; Together with StrongLoop, IBM now has the most comprehensive and open API platform in the industry.  It supports the FULL LIFECYCLE of APIs; Design, Discover, Connect, Assemble, Connect, Deploy, Scale and Manage.</p>\n<p><i style=\"font-size: 90%;\">Read more on <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/gcuomo/entry/The_Million_API_Jam_is_ON_Now_ShowYourSwagger\">Jerry&#8217;s blog</a> on developerWorks community&#8230;</i></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/09/ibm-acquires-strongloop/","date":"2015-09-10T11:00:20","modified":"2016-12-07T16:25:14","format":"standard","slug":"ibm-acquires-strongloop","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=22202","excerpt":"<p>The team at StrongLoop, Inc. helps companies succeed in connecting mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and next-generation web applications with enterprise data and services in a hybrid cloud environment.

Specifically, the default Liberty features for WAR and EAR applications will change from Java EE 6 Web Profile features to Java EE 7 Web Profile features and the default Java version will change from 7 to 8. Some applications might be adversely impacted by these changes. However, there are steps you can take to ensure your application will not be affected by these changes.</p>\n<h2>Default Liberty Features</h2>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#optionsforpushinglibertyapplications__Stand-aloneApplications\">deploying WAR or EAR files</a>, the Liberty buildpack provides a default Liberty configuration file for the application. The default configuration file enables a set of Liberty features that the application might need. Currently, that feature set provides Java EE 6 Web Profile functionality. In the upcoming Liberty buildpack v2, the feature set will enable Java EE 7 Web Profile functionality.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the following list of Liberty features will be enabled in the default configuration:</p>\n<ul>\n<i>beanValidation-1.1</i>, <i>cdi-1.2</i>, <i>ejbLite-3.2</i>, <i>el-3.0</i>, <i>jaxrs-2.0</i>, <i>jdbc-4.1</i>, <i>jndi-1.0</i>, <i>jpa-2.1</i>, <i>jsf-2.2</i>, <i>jsonp-1.0</i>, <i>jsp-2.3</i>, <i>managedBeans-1.0</i>, <i>servlet-3.1</i>, <i>websocket-1.1</i>.\n</ul>\n<p>The change in the default feature set <b>might adversely</b> affect some WAR or EAR applications due to changes in the specification levels or in their implementations. For example, if your application assumed <a href=\"http://openjpa.apache.org/\">Apache OpenJPA</a> as the JPA provider, it may no longer work as expected since the <i>jpa-2.1</i> (EE 7) feature uses <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/\">EclipseLink</a> as the JPA provider instead of OpenJPA as in the <i>jpa-2.0</i> (EE 6) feature. You can see the full list of <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_prog_model_jee7behaviors.html\">behavior changes in the Liberty profile documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Please note that the applications deployed via a <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#optionsforpushinglibertyapplications__PackagedServer\">packaged server</a> or <a href=\"\nhttps://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#optionsforpushinglibertyapplications__ServerDirectory\">server directory</a> <b>will not be affected</b>. That is because the buildpack provides both Java EE 6 and 7 features and the features specified in the <i>server.xml</i> supplied with the application will continue to be used.</p>\n<p>If you are deploying a WAR or EAR file and your application might be adversely impacted by the feature changes, you can configure the application to continue to use Java EE 6 features. That can be done in a couple of ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><i>Use a configuration override environment variable:</i> Set the <code>JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY</code> environment variable to specify a list of enabled features. For example, using the <code>cf</code> command-line client:\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$ cf set-env myApp JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY &quot;app_archive: {features: [jsf-2.0, jsp-2.2, servlet-3.0, ejbLite-3.1, cdi-1.0, jpa-2.0, jdbc-4.0, jndi-1.0, managedBeans-1.0, jaxrs-1.1]}&quot;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to restage your application after setting the environment variable. This environment variable can also be set in your <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/deployingapps.html#appmanifest\">manifest.yml</a> file.\n</li>\n<li><i>Convert to a server directory or a packaged server:</i> Follow the instructions to create a <a href=\"\nhttps://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#optionsforpushinglibertyapplications__ServerDirectory\">server directory</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#optionsforpushinglibertyapplications__PackagedServer\">packaged server</a> for your application with <code>server.xml</code> that specifies the Java EE 6 features needed by the application.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Default Java Version</h2>\n<p>The Liberty buildpack v2 will use IBM JRE 8 by default. Similarly, if an application is configured to use OpenJDK as the JRE, the buildpack will default to OpenJDK 8. If version 8 of IBM JRE or OpenJDK might not work with your application, you can set Java to version 7 by setting an appropriate environment variable. For example:</p>\n<p>For IBM JRE set:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$ cf set-env myApp JBP_CONFIG_IBMJDK &quot;version: 1.7.+&quot;\r\n</pre>\n<p>For OpenJDK set:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$ cf set-env myApp JBP_CONFIG_OPENJDK &quot;version: 1.7.+&quot;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to restage your application after setting the environment variable. These environment variables can also be set in your <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/deployingapps.html#appmanifest\">manifest.yml</a> file. For additional information on setting the Java version and other JVM options see the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#customizingjre\">Customizing the JRE</a> documentation.</p>\n<h2>Buildpack Preview</h2>\n<p>We have made a preview of the Liberty buildpack v2 available in Bluemix as non-default buildpack. You can test your application with this buildpack by specifying <code>liberty-for-java-new</code> as the buildpack name when you deploy your application to Bluemix. For example, if you are using the <code>cf</code> command-line client to deploy your application use:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$ cf push appName -p myapp.war -b liberty-for-java-new\r\n</pre>\n<p>We have also provided a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/ibm-websphere-liberty-buildpack/master/docs/configuration/manifest.yml\">sample manifest.yml</a> file that sets the current Liberty buildpack defaults via the environment variables. You can use this manifest file and apply to your application <i>now</i> to ensure it will not be affected once the Liberty buildpack v2 is released.</p>\n<p>The Liberty buildpack v2 is due to be out on September 18th.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/09/upcoming-liberty-for-java-buildpack-changes/","date":"2015-09-08T03:00:26","modified":"2017-01-11T05:58:40","format":"standard","slug":"upcoming-liberty-for-java-buildpack-changes","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=21658","excerpt":"<p>As previously announced, we will be making two major changes to the Liberty for Java buildpack in Bluemix.

This generates a huge volume and variety of data that is under-utilized…or often not used at all!  Enterprises can leverage this data to understand the state of operations and equipment to better run their businesses.  The key to achieving that efficiency is to utilize IoT data effectively to drive business decisions and results.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To leverage the IoT for business decisions, companies need help processing large amounts of data to drive real-time actions. </p></blockquote>\n<p>There is far too much data being produced to even consider doing anything manually.  Organizations need help processing large amounts of data in real-time and driving real-time actions from that data. To address these challenges, IBM is introducing a new Internet of Things analytics offering:  IBM IoT Real-Time Insights.</p>\n<h2>IBM IoT Real-Time Insights</h2>\n<p>A key service in IBM’s IoT Platform, IoT Real-Time Insights consumes data from IoT devices and provides awareness and understanding from that data through real-time contextualization and visualization.  It enables organizations to monitor equipment and operations to understand and respond to emerging conditions to improve responsiveness, equipment availability, and overall efficiency.  IoT Real-Time Insights can be used for several common monitoring patterns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor devices to understand current conditions and status, usage patterns, availability, and performance\n<li>Monitor operational processes to track progress towards milestones and business outcomes\n<li>Monitor environmental conditions to identify security issues and unsafe or undesirable situations\n</ul>\n<p>And when conditions warrant it, IoT Real-Time Insights allows you to automate a response to those conditions. IoT Real-Time Insights enables organizations to gain awareness of equipment and operations through four simple steps:</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Enrich the data to understand it in context</h3>\n<p>Raw data from IoT connected devices and sensors is just that, raw.  It may need to be transformed or normalized, and it definitely needs to be linked to information from systems of record where master data about assets lives.  This linkage is vital to understanding data in context.  IoT Real-Time Insights enables this context through integration with systems like Maximo Asset Management which contain master records about equipment such as the make and model, when it was purchased, when it was put into service, as well as historical information about repairs and maintenance.  This information provides valuable context which enables a greater level of understanding about how things operate in the field.  Additionally, IoT Real-Time Insights enables integration of correlating data sources such as weather.  Weather and environmental conditions are a common factor in the performance of equipment and operations.  By linking these types of data sources with IoT data from devices, you can gain even greater insight into their performance and health.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Apply rules to identify issues</h3>\n<p>From simple thresholds to more complex correlations, rules monitor the ongoing conditions of equipment and operations.  Well known conditions such as operating specifications and normal or expected usage patterns can be encoded in rules that trigger when these conditions are violated.  But IoT presents challenges in terms of the volume and variety of devices and data which traditional rules engines are not designed to handle.  IoT Real-Time Insights delivers a highly scalable, parallel processing rules engine which is designed from the ground up for IoT data.  It was designed, developed, and tested working with IBM Research and some of the earliest, large scale IoT projects.  IoT Real-Time Insights also provides an intuitive, visual rules editor that can be used by a wide range of users from business users and technicians to more advanced IT users.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Visualize what’s happening now</h3>\n<p>Often, you just need to see what’s happening now—where are all my things, what alerts were triggered during the last shift, how is that asset we repaired yesterday performing? IoT Real-Time Insights provides a configurable dashboard which presents a contextual view of all of your devices.  It provides a map to see device locations, current and recent property values, and alerts including the rule that generated it and the conditions which caused it.  All of this is delivered through a user friendly, configurable dashboard, so users can tailor real-time visualizations to their specific needs and responsibilities.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Automate actions when issues arise</h3>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, the scale of IoT demands an increasing amount of automation.  There are simply too many devices and too much data for manual processes and business as usual.  You need to automate responses to abnormal conditions and issues.  IoT Real-Time Insights provides an action engine that can do simple things such as send an SMS message or an email when a rule is triggered.  But it also allows you to take actions through external ‘systems of action’.  For example, you can configure a rule to create a work order in Maximo to inspect or repair a troublesome asset.  Maximo’s work order engine assigns personnel with the right skills, tools, and spare parts to efficiently complete the job.  Further, Maximo can escalate a work order if it is not completed in a timely manner.  The combination of IoT Real-Time Insights and Maximo provides a closed loop response to issues in the operational environment, providing traceability from the sensor data to the asset to the response all through an automated process.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>IoT Real-Time Insights consumes the data and device information, enriches that data with asset master records and weather data, and applies rules to take action when conditions warrant enabling you to gain awareness of equipment and operations to make better decisions, improve availability, and respond more quickly to emerging conditions.<br />\nCan’t wait to get started?

The focus of this new version is security, and the sections below outlines the change and new capabilities.</p>\n<h3>New XPages Runtime Environment Variable</h3>\n<p>A new <code>APP_JAVA_POLICY_ALL_PERMISSION</code> environment variable has been added to the XPages runtime. In advanced XPages applications, you may encounter a situation where your custom Java code does not have permission to run. Setting a value of &#8220;1&#8221; on this variable allows the privileged execution of any Java code in the XPages runtime, including any code contained in your XPages NSF. This is achieved by applying <code>grant {permission java.security.AllPermission;}</code> to the JVM security policy file inside the XPages runtime container.</p>\n<p>Enabling this capability, however, can be a security risk. For this reason, the variable is set to &#8220;0&#8221; (disabled) by default in the XPages runtime, restricting the level of privileged code execution. This new variable adds to the list of supported environment variables in the XPages runtime, which you can read about in the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/xpages/index.html#xpruntime_xprt_envivariables\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>. To allow more precise control of Java permission levels, rather than using the new environment variable, you can use another new feature that has been added to the XPages runtime.</p>\n<h3>Fine-grained XPages Java Policy</h3>\n<p>Instead of giving Java code a wide-open permission level, you may prefer to define a more detailed set of policies. This can be achieved by creating a <code>java.policy-fragment</code> file in the deployment directory of your application. If a file with this exact name is detected in the deployment folder by the runtime and <code>APP_JAVA_POLICY_ALL_PERMISSION</code> is disabled, the contents of your fragment file is merged into the global JVM security policy file when your application is being deployed in Bluemix. For example, a <code>java.policy-fragment</code> file containing the following would give permission to Java code inside <code>example.nsf</code> to access the &#8220;PATH&#8221; system environment variable: <code>grant codeBase \"xspnsf://server:0/example.nsf/-\" {permission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"getenv.PATH\";}</code></p>\n<h3>Updated Tooling</h3>\n<p>Along with the XPages runtime update, the Domino Designer Bluemix tooling has been updated as well. This tooling is available as part of release 14 of the open source <a href=\"http://extlib.openntf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">XPages Extension Library on OpenNTF</a>. In the Bluemix Manifest editor in Designer, you can now set all of the XPages specific environment variables in a dedicated panel. This includes the ability to set the new Java security variable. And each one has an informative tooltip to describe what it does.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/des-blog-1.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" /><br />\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/xpages/index.html#xpruntime_xprt_envivariables\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> for a list of all the available environment variables. </p>\n<p>All of these new features in the XPages runtime give you more control over the security of your XPages applications running in Bluemix. You can read more about the XPages Java security policy in Chapter 21 of the book &#8220;Mastering XPages : Second Edition&#8221;, available from <a href=\"http://www.ibmpressbooks.com/store/mastering-xpages-a-step-by-step-guide-to-xpages-application-9780133373370\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Press</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-XPages-Step-Step-Application/dp/0133373371\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/09/xpages-runtime-update/","date":"2015-09-01T10:40:55","modified":"2016-12-07T16:33:55","format":"standard","slug":"xpages-runtime-update","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=21666","excerpt":"<p>An update to the XPages runtime on Bluemix has been released this week, as well as a refresh of the Bluemix tooling in Domino Designer.

The <code>cf buildpack</code> result is scraped using <code>awk</code> and sent to the client using socket.io. This is executed on each target automatically every 90 minutes for updates. There is a manual override so that users can issue a refresh if they want to see the most current buildpack versions at that moment. This can only be done every 3 minutes to prevent the <code>cf buildpacks</code> command from being executed multiple times in a short period from many users.</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave feedback and to use the <a href=\"http://bpversions.mybluemix.net/\">Buildpack Versions</a> application as much as you want!</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/08/buildpack-versions-application/","date":"2015-08-21T03:00:31","modified":"2016-12-07T16:33:58","format":"standard","slug":"buildpack-versions-application","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=21074","excerpt":"<p><i>Buildpack Versions</i> is an application hosted on Bluemix that retrieves information from the <code>cf buildpacks</code> command and displays the result in an easy-to-read format, telling developers exactly which buildpack versions are in which target.</p>\n","menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America/New_York","date_gmt":"2015-08-21T07:00:31","modified_tz":"America/New_York","modified_gmt":"2016-12-07T21:33:58","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/21074","author":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/279","collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts","replies":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/21074/comments","version-history":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/21074/revisions"}},"featured_image":{"errors":{"json_post_invalid_type":["Invalid post type"]},"error_data":{"json_post_invalid_type":{"status":400}}},"terms":{"post_tag":[{"ID":561,"name":"Bluemix","slug":"bluemix","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":508,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/bluemix/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/561"}}},{"ID":727,"name":"buildpacks","slug":"buildpacks","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":34,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/buildpacks/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/727"}}}],"category":[{"ID":1963,"name":"What's New","slug":"whats-new","description":"<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-orange-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-categories-_-general\">Get started with Bluemix today</a></p>","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":273,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/category/whats-new/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/1963"}}}]}},{"ID":21040,"title":"Device Management is now live in IoT","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":205,"username":"andrew_schofield@uk.ibm.com","name":"Andrew Schofield","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Schofield","nickname":"andrew_schofield@uk.ibm.com","slug":"andrew_schofielduk-ibm-com","URL":"","avatar":"","description":"","registered":"2016-09-22T14:35:04+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/205","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/205/posts"}}},"content":"<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iot_catalog_hero.png\" class=\"alignright\" /> I’d like to tell you about a major new enhancement we’ve just made to the Internet of Things Foundation service. We call it Device Management, and it’s all about making it easy and efficient to manage lots of IoT devices.</p>\n<h2>What is Device Management anyway?</h2>\n<p>When I talk to customers about their IoT plans, they generally mention the phrase “device management”. It doesn’t matter whether they’re talking about connected cars, connected light bulbs or connected refrigerators, there’s usually device management in there somewhere. So, what does it mean and why does everyone want it? Well, it includes things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bulk operations on many devices at a time</li>\n<li>Rich device metadata and status information</li>\n<li>Diagnostic information, both for connectivity and for the devices themselves</li>\n<li>Device management actions, most notably firmware update</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And all of these things need to be made easily accessible via APIs and dashboards.</p>\n<h3>Managed devices</h3>\n<p>In order to benefit from device management, your devices need to be a bit smarter. Specifically they need to be managed devices. A managed device has a piece of code called a <i>device management agent</i> which exchanges special device management messages with IoT Foundation over MQTT. There’s nothing very complicated about a device management agent. The device management messages are quite simple, and you need only use as much or as little of the capabilities as your device requires.</p>\n<p>We will provide sample implementations of device management agents, and you can use these as the basis of the agent for your own devices. That typically will mean adding a few lines of code to the sample. The step from an unmanaged device using MQTT to a managed device with a basic device management agent is very small indeed. We will also provide recipes for device management.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, a device management agent needs to send a message to IoTF telling it that it wants to be a managed device. This message also includes a summary of the device’s capabilities, such as whether it can have its firmware updated.</p>\n<p>You can pick and choose the features of device management that you want to use. For example, if you want your device to be able to send diagnostic information to IoTF, you add that capability to your device management agent. If your device is mobile and you want it to update its location information in IoTF, you can add that feature to your device management agent.</p>\n<h3>Device metadata</h3>\n<p>Imagine that you’re producing a new range of connected blenders. Each blender has a manufacturer, model and serial number. So that the blenders can connect to IoT Foundation, you add them as new devices to your IoTF organisation. When you do this, it would be nice to be able to associate the serial number and so on with the devices. Then, you can tie back information from a device in IoTF to the actual blender you produced.</p>\n<p>These are examples of <i>device metadata</i>. As the number of devices increases, having the ability to associate metadata with the devices helps you manage the devices efficiently. For example, if a customer calls the service line with a blender problem, you can ask for the serial number and then use this to find the device in IoTF which corresponds to that blender. You can dive down into the diagnostic information for the device and perhaps work out how to resolve the problem.</p>\n<p>Another example of device metadata is called <i>descriptive location</i>. There’s longitude and latitude too, but in many cases a less rigorous idea of location such as “Building 43, floor 2” is much more useful. That’s a much more descriptive way of expressing location.</p>\n<h3>Diagnostic information</h3>\n<p>If you’re managing a large number of devices, some of them are bound to have problems. These might include connectivity problems, or perhaps an unexpected situation discovered by the device firmware.</p>\n<p>We’ve added <i>connectivity logs</i> to our API and dashboard. These let you see significant connectivity events for devices, such as why a device disconnected. If you are having connectivity problems, these logs will help you figure out what’s wrong.</p>\n<p>Devices can also report diagnostic information to IoT Foundation. The simplest are <i>error codes</i>. These are just numbers which represent error conditions, suitable for the simplest devices. If a device notices an error, its device management agent can send the error code to IoT Foundation.</p>\n<p>More sophisticated devices can report <i>error logs</i> instead. Each error log entry includes a timestamp, a description of the problem and perhaps a block of diagnostics data captured by the device.</p>\n<p>When a device reports an error code or a high-severity error log, IoT Foundation automatically highlights the device as being in an <i>alert</i> state in the IoT Foundation dashboard. This makes it simple for the operator to notice the problem and act on it.</p>\n<p>Again, it’s all about efficiently managing devices.</p>\n<h2>Device management actions</h2>\n<p><i>Device management actions</i> are a way of remotely managing devices from IoT Foundation. There are four actions supported initially:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reboot</li>\n<li>Factory reset</li>\n<li>Firmware download</li>\n<li>Firmware update.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can initiate device management actions from the API or the dashboard. You can perform an action on up to 5000 devices at a time in a single request. Of course, a request such as rebooting 5000 devices doesn’t complete immediately, so you can see the requests in progress and whether the devices successfully performed the action.</p>\n<p>Managed devices don’t have to support any actions, but if they do, the device management agent is responsible for receiving the initiation command and performing the action. For example, to reboot a device, it’s likely that there’s a system call in the device firmware which actually reboots the device. The device management agent would simply invoke this system call when it receives the command from IoTF. Once the device has rebooted, it reconnects to IoT Foundation and sends a message indicating that it’s back. This completes the device’s part in the overall management request.</p>\n<h2>Building your own tools with our API</h2>\n<p>As part of this, we’ve massively enhanced our API. Having an easy-to-use API is important because it makes automation simple. We had three principles in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The API must work well even if you have millions of devices. So, there is filtering of results (“give me a list of the washing machines of type ‘WM123’ at firmware level 17”) and paging so you can get a huge set of results in manageable chunks.</li>\n<li>Everything we do in our dashboard UI can be done with the API. Soon, in the dashboard, we will add “API” buttons which you will be able to press to reveal the API calls we use to request the data shown in the dashboard. If you’re trying to create your own tools based on the IoTF API, this will be a big help.</li>\n<li>Whenever possible, the API follows REST principles. Basically, this means that the behaviour of the API is predictable to developers familiar with REST. For example, resources are grouped into collections. If you use HTTP GET on a collection, you get a list of the resources in the collection. If you use HTTP GET on a single resource such as a device, you get the details about that device. In neither case are any resources modified, so you can safely use these operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, we have documented the API using a notation called Swagger. There are a lot of tools for Swagger, so whether you want an easy-to-browse view of the API or a generated client library so you don’t have to use HTTP directly yourself, having a Swagger definition is great.</p>\n<h2>Designing the service</h2>\n<p>In the IoT Foundation team, we put a lot of effort into designing the service so it meets the needs of specific target users. We have people dedicated to designing the user experience and the visuals of the dashboard. You can clearly see the importance we place on the experience when you first start using the service. Sophie Riches, who is a User Experience Designer in our team, will tell you much more about this soon.</p>\n<h2>What next?</h2>\n<p>A good place to start is the documentation about device management in IoTF which can be found <a href=\"https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/device_mgmt/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re already using Internet of Things Foundation, you’ll notice the changes in your dashboard. You can convert existing unmanaged devices into managed devices by adding a device management agent. We will be providing sample implementations of device management agents, which you can refer to or use as the basis of your own agent.</p>\n<p>We will be adding new recipes for device management over the coming weeks, so if you’ve already got experience with using IoT Foundation, you’ll easily be able to start using device management also.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/08/iot-device-management-now-live/","date":"2015-08-17T13:10:13","modified":"2016-12-07T16:25:16","format":"standard","slug":"iot-device-management-now-live","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=21040","excerpt":"<p>I’d like to tell you about a major new enhancement we’ve just made to the Internet of Things Foundation service.

use operators from the SPSS Analytics Toolkit in in your Streams applications, these operators are now enabled in the Streaming Analytics service.  With this support, your Streams application in the cloud can perform in-stream predictive scoring on predefined SPSS models.  To use the SPSS Analytics toolkit in your application, you will need to have the the <em>SPSS Solution Publisher</em> product installed in the development environment that you use to develop Streams applications for deployment to the cloud.</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/spss-in-bluemix-streaming-analytics-service\" target=\"_blank\">Support for SPSS Analytics Toolkit in Bluemix Streaming Analytics Service</a> describes what you need to do to use the SPSS Analytics Toolkit in your Streaming Analytics instance, and provides some code examples to get you started.</p>\n<h2>New Streams Console</h2>\n<p>The web console that you can launch from the Streaming Analytics service has changed.  The new console better-oriented to the cloud user, and focused on your individual Streams instance provided by the Streaming Analytics service.  The new console provides a shorter path to common tasks like submitting jobs, and removes a lot of the information and actions not directly related to your Streams instance in the cloud.  Below is a screenshot of the new console:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2015/08/NewConsole.jpg\"><img

It’s actually a very nifty concept; you pay for the capacity you need, you don’t need to worry about managing the hardware or administering the database, and to top it off the actual service itself is continually being upgraded with new features and capabilities on a much more rapid pace than with conventional database offerings.</p>\n<p>Since dashDB has been out for a while already, a logical question is why IBM chose now to suddenly put a big new push behind it? And the answer to that is that dashDB has recently added MPP scale out capabilities, which means that it is no longer constrained by single server capacity and can provide truly massive warehousing capacity through clustering.</p>\n<p>That’s all nice and good, but what’s particularly interesting here is that dashDB is built on top of IBM’s BLU Acceleration in-memory column store technology, and up until this point, BLU Acceleration has only been available as a single server offering. So has IBM actually extended its BLU technology into a true MPP column store? Or, is this some type of sleight of hand where they’ve just stitched together a bunch of single server databases and called it “BLU MPP”? Does dashDB really deliver the promised “BLU Acceleration” at MPP scale?</p>\n<p>As it turns out, the answer is a resounding yes –- this is in fact the real deal! I have a bit of an inside track as one of the lead architects involved in the project, and I’ve had the privilege of working with a very talented team of engineers to bring this technology to fruition.</p>\n<p>We have built MPP awareness directly into the BLU columnar query engine. This means that our query planning and optimization are fully MPP aware. We’ve also taken great pains to ensure that the boundaries where the data crosses the network fit seamlessly into the accelerated columnar query processing. To achieve this we’ve enabled BLU to exchange data between servers directly within the columnar query engine in its native columnar vector format. Finally, we&#8217;ve built a communications infrastructure that is optimized for highly parallel multi-core systems and allows us to maintain parallelism on both ends of the network pipe. The end result is that when the columnar query engine needs to exchange data across the network, it can do this in optimized columnar form, and in a highly parallel manner –- almost as if the network wasn’t there. So you get all the existing benefits of BLU Acceleration like dynamic in-memory processing on compressed columnar data, parallel vector processing, data skipping, but now you get it at massive scale.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/blumpp.png\" alt=\"blumpp\" /></p>\n<p>So what sort of difference are you going to see between the biggest dashDB single server offering and the new dashDB MPP scale offerings? The differences are actually quite significant; in addition to being able to offer massive scale in terms of storage and compute capacity, the dashDB MPP offering also boasts more memory per core and an improved I/O subsystem.</p>\n<p>My colleague @Michael_KF_KWOK has run some internal comparison benchmarks between our dashDB 4TB single node offering and our dashDB MPP 3-server offering with a parallel workload generated by IBM Cognos. In these tests, he measured an overall throughput speedup of 10x(!).

I’d like to welcome the Compose team to their new home in the IBM Cloud Data Services group. Compose built their business operating MongoDB for customers and has added PostgreSQL, Redis, RethinkDB, and Elasticsearch over time. Their services will be the perfect complement to Cloudant’s Apache CouchDB-based service and to IBM’s cloud data warehouse, dashDB, among other Bluemix services.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to reflect on Cloudant’s history. From our startup days and through our own IBM acquisition, I think there are some interesting comparisons between Cloudant and Compose, in terms of company origins, strategies, and technologies. I hope they will help explain the motivations for the acquisition and the plans for Compose within the CDS group.</p>\n<h2>The origins of an acquisition</h2>\n<p>Compose and Cloudant watched each other’s progress. (I know from the running debates we had at Cloudant board meetings.) According to startup lore, Compose was inspired to start the company, founded as “MongoHQ,” after attending the No:SQL (east) conference that my Cloudant colleagues organized back in 2009 (<a href=\"https://cloudant.com/blog/cloudant-at-nosql-east/#.Va0G6SpViko\">blog</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nosqleast\">Twitter</a>). At this point, Cloudant was a year removed from graduating from the Y Combinator Spring 2008 class. Compose would go on to finish its own YC batch, completing the Spring 2011 session.</p>\n<h2>The strategy to market</h2>\n<p>Although we started down a similar path, Compose and Cloudant took different routes to market.</p>\n<p>For startups like us, it was all a matter of scope. Cloudant went deep into extending and operationalizing a particular database: Apache CouchDB. Compose went broad, choosing to embrace the richness and variety of an entire database ecosystem to develop a platform for operating a portfolio of database services. Both approaches have their benefits. After all, Compose and Cloudant ended up at the same place.</p>\n<p>In IBM Cloud Data Services, our strategy is to give people the right tools for the job at hand. The Cloudant and Compose acquisitions emphasize this polyglot database worldview. It’s no longer about supplanting one monolithic DBMS with another. Microservices architectures and modern programming trends encourage developers to optimize data persistence at every level of the stack. As CDS, we need to deliver this experience for more developers to take advantage of the IBM cloud. In Compose, we have added an important piece.</p>\n<h2>Technological innovation</h2>\n<p>The Compose team saw benefits of containerization earlier than many others. Using containers, they designed their platform to quickly and reliably onboard new services. This agility has allowed Compose to experiment with all the innovations happening in the database space today.</p>\n<p>Infrastructure further highlights this agility. Cloudant optimized its system across providers like SoftLayer, AWS, Rackspace, and Microsoft Azure. We built our own operations and monitoring systems specifically for the cloud, and tuned Cloudant for each provider’s environment. Compose designed its service to run in the public cloud, but containerization caused the Compose team to gain a unique understanding of the full stack involved in its service. To the point where Compose now also manages deployments running in data center colocation facilities around the world.</p>\n<p>It speaks to the maturity of the company Compose has built. From a data management perspective, they know how to use the cloud to get capacity online rapidly, but also how to optimize infrastructure to deliver a premium experience for customers and their applications.</p>\n<h2>Welcome to the team</h2>\n<p>The Compose acquisition will help us grow IBM Cloud Data Services, and expands our products in an authentic way that developers need. In closing, please join me, once again, in welcoming the Compose team to IBM. Let’s go run some databases! 😉</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/07/welcome-compose/","date":"2015-07-23T12:00:59","modified":"2016-12-07T16:25:40","format":"standard","slug":"welcome-compose","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=19711","excerpt":"<p>I’d like to welcome the Compose team to their new home in the IBM Cloud Data Services group.

These investments demonstrate IBM&#8217;s commitment to open source technologies, and together are one of the largest ventures our company has made in the open source arena since Linux.</p>\n<p>The highlight of IBM’s announcement is the introduction of Apache Spark as a service, IBM Analytics for Apache Spark, available in IBM Bluemix, IBM’s platform for cloud services. IBM views Spark as a transformational technology, with powerful new capabilities that have the potential to materially change the way businesses manage thru digital transformation. On behalf of the IBM Analytics Apache for Spark team, we are all very excited to make that power accessible and useful to you.</p>\n<blockquote><p>IBM Analytics for Apache Spark will enable powerful analytics without the hassle of setup, maintenance and operations </p></blockquote>\n<p>My interest in bringing this product to life is deeply personal. As a prior VP of Analytics at a public cable company, I lived the challenge on a day-to-day basis of generating meaningful insights from highly disparate data.  While I had a great team, they each used very different tools and thus were highly siloed by default. Having several specialized tools did not mean that they were efficient &#8211; simple analysis and changes required great efforts regardless of the specific tool. For those reasons, I’m very excited about the potential of Spark and its ability to truly transform businesses, and to do so in a common platform that can be used by anyone from an entry level analyst to a data scientist to a developer. Looking back, I realize today that we are finally in a place that I could only imagine several years back. I’m helping build the tool I wish I had had, and am personally very gratified to see IBM’s vision come to life.</p>\n<h2>IBM Analytics for Apache Spark</h2>\n<p>IBM will soon introduce a public beta of IBM Analytics for Apache Spark for developers, business analysts, and data scientists to embrace and take advantage of Apache Spark at no cost.

Such insights can be used for a number of purposes including personal and business communications, self-branding, market research, public relations management and automated contact center management.</p>\n<h2>Tone Analyzer Scorecard</h2>\n<p>The constituent parts of the three dimensions of Tone Analyzer Scorecard are explained below.</p>\n<p><b>Emotional Tone</b>: Many psychology models exist in literature to capture human emotions such as anger, fear, anticipation, surprise, joy, sadness, trust, and disgust. We have developed a model for inferring emotions from written text. Tone Analyzer captures the salient three among these that we found to be relevant for Tone analysis based on our user studies. These include: cheerfulness, negative emotions and anger. Cheerfulness refers to positive emotions such as joy, optimism, contentment, inspiration, and happiness. Negative emotions include feelings of fear, disgust, despair, guilt, rejection, and humiliation. Anger is a type of negative feeling with strong intensity such as annoyance, hostility, aggression, hurt, frustration and rage.</p>\n<p><b>Social Tone</b>: Social tone includes aspects of social propensities in people&#8217;s personality. Tone Analyzer currently uses three social tones namely: openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness adopted from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_five_personality_traits\" target=\"_blank\">the Big-five personality model</a>. Specifically, openness is the extent to which a person is open to experience a variety of activities; agreeableness is a tendency to be compassionate and cooperative towards others; and conscientiousness is a tendency to act in an organized or thoughtful way. We use these three dimensions to illustrate the openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness of the writer as reflected in the text.</p>\n<p><b>Writing Style/Tone</b>: Writing tone provides feedback on how analytical, confident and tentative one’s writing is. Analytical tone shows a person&#8217;s reasoning and analytical attitude about things. Confidence tone indicates the degree of certainty exhibited by an individual towards something. Tentative tone shows the attitude of inhibition.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Tone Analyzer service explains which words in the provided text contributed to which tone. Furthermore, it offers alternate word suggestions to refine the text to reflect desired tones. There is no minimum word requirement for the text input in order for the Tone Analyzer service to perform its functions well.</p>\n<h2>Try Watson Tone Analyzer!</h2>\n<p>The IBM Watson Tone Analyzer demo application shows how it works by requesting input text:</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tone-analyzer-input.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Select <strong>Analyze</strong> to show the Tone scorecard along with explanation on which words contributed to what tone:</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tone-analyzer-analysis.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Clicking one of the words above offers alternative words that refine the tone:</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tone-analyzer-suggestions.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The ability to assess tone automatically becomes especially important in situations where: (a) it is impractical for humans to process large volume of articles/text to derive insights or (b) humans need the aid of a tool to act as their inner critic or tone assistant in helping refine a message being drafted or (c) virtual agents interacting with humans could benefit from understanding the tone of users to respond to them appropriately.</p>\n<p>Application developers can write email and other social media connections tool plugins (e.g., for Facebook posts, blog posts, or dating applications) to help authors be aware of the tones they reflect in their writing and to help them refine their messages to reflect the desired tones before sending the message, thereby, potentially avoiding regrets and miscommunications. Competitive market intelligence teams, marketing teams and public relations teams can use this service to automatically assess the tone reflected in the various marketing messages, media mentions and announcements of competitors, or their own companies to flag the ones that need special attention. When combined with the IBM Speech to Text service, the Tone Analyzer service can be a powerful tool in helping humans communicate more effectively.</p>\n<p><span class=\"prs\"><a class=\"pn-btn pn-btn-secondary\" title=\"Sign up for IBM Bluemix and start building\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/\">Sign up for IBM Bluemix and start building</a></span></p>\n<p>The experimental service is currently available for English text input, and is free for exploration.

Here&#8217;s what makes it tick.</p>\n<h3>What is MPP?</h3>\n<p>MPP &#8211; massively parallel processing &#8211; is a network cluster architecture that works by leveraging multiple servers and processors to process data simultaneously. In a standard architecture, parallelization only occurs at the processor level; in the MPP architecture, a query is broken into pieces (or shards) so multiple servers can work on separate pieces of the data, thus reducing I/O requirements and drastically speeding up the querying process. Scaling out is therefore as simple as adding additional servers to the cluster.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-23-at-5.33.19-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Why MPP for cloud data warehousing?</h3>\n<p>dashDB is powered by <a href=\"http://www.ibmbluhub.com/why-blu-acceleration/\">IBM BLU Acceleration</a>, dynamic in-memory column store technology which minimizes I/O to achieve an order of magnitude in speedup compared to standard row-store databases. These benefits are amplified through the MPP architecture. Whenever dashDB MPP is performing joins or aggregation processing, data is exchanged between servers entirely within BLU runtime in native columnar format. Use of a common table dictionary further keeps data in optimized form during query processing. The results: minimal I/O, maximum performance, improved bandwidth and lower CPU costs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-23-at-6.03.16-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Proven performance</h3>\n<p>An IBM benchmark has shown that a deep analytic workload achieved a performance speedup of 10 times on a dashDB MPP instance (three-server configuration) when compared to a dashDB Enterprise single-server instance (4TB server configuration). The benchmark measured the performance of 60 concurrent query streams generated by an IBM Cognos application, in combination with queries from a public benchmark. This is achieved by leveraging MPP parallelism for heavy group-by / join queries.</p>\n<p>dashDB MPP gains even more performance benefits from the latest generation of Intel Xeon E5 v3 processors, with efficient scaling up to a greater number of cores, delivering faster response times and improved memory bandwidth.</p>\n<h3>dashDB MPP in action</h3>\n<p>One customer is already using dashDB MPP to move 60+ on premise SQL Server data marts to the cloud. The company, which maintains customer data for sports and entertainment venues, is incrementally migrating their data to dashDB so they can accelerate their analytics and reporting &#8211; with no need to manage the data warehousing infrastructure themselves! With dashDB, IBM manages the setup, configuration and tuning, so you can get straight to building your newest solutions, applications and architectures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-23-at-6.41.43-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Get started</h3>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to extend your existing on premise appliance to the cloud, need a data store for running R analytics at scale, or want to build an entirely new, standalone cloud data warehouse, you can start doing so today with dashDB. You can try for free up to 1 GB, and contact an IBM sales rep to learn more about dashDB MPP and other dashDB Enterprise service offerings.

This post outlines some of the highlights.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/node-red-updates_sm.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>New AlchemyAPI Nodes</h2>\n<p>There are two new nodes (Feature Extract and Image Extract) in the package, allowing users to call services from the AlchemyAPI platform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Feature Extract.</em> This node will analyse external URLs, HTML or text content with features for text-based analysis from the AlchemyAPI service, e.g. keywords, sentiment, relationships, etc.</li>\n<li><em>Image Analysis.</em> This node will analyse images, passed in as external URLs or raw image bytes, to extract faces, content and URLs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Configuration for each node is available through the node editor panel.</p>\n<p>For full details on all the capabilities of the AlchemyAPI platform, please see their <a href=\"http://www.alchemyapi.com/api\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Updated IBM Watson Nodes</h2>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/watson/blog/2015/07/06/ibm-watson-language-translation-and-speech-services-general-availability/\">recent changes</a> to the IBM Watson services, there were a number of changes needed to support the API changes. All the IBM Watson nodes now work with the generally available (GA) versions of the services.</p>\n<p>Note: Users must ensure they are using GA versions of the service with the nodes. Details on migration steps are available on the IBM Watson <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/watson/blog/2015/07/06/ibm-watson-language-translation-and-speech-services-general-availability/\">blog post</a> about the updates.</p>\n<h2>Running Locally</h2>\n<p>When running Node-RED on IBM Bluemix, credentials for the services bound to the application are automatically registered. Previously, running the nodes outside of IBM Bluemix required complex configuration to register service credentials.

Based on feedback from our partners, this feature will allow customers with large populations to normalize scores against their own population, improving their ability to analyze and compare results within their own population. If chosen, the raw trait scores are delivered together with their corresponding raw sampling error, which qualifies the accuracy of the reported raw score based on the amount of input text provided.</li>\n<li><b>More documentation for guidance and insight in applying the service</b><br />\nAvailable online, <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/personality-insights/applied.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">studies conducted by IBM researchers</a> show the service in action.

We&#8217;re now providing you more flexibility to connect to services with the introduction of <em>service keys</em>. Service keys give you access to the credentials for a given service instance without requiring an application binding. This is especially useful if you&#8217;d like to use a service from outside of Bluemix.</p>\n<p>To get started, find a service in the Catalog which supports service keys (for example, <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/concept-insights/\" target=\"_blank\">Concept Insights</a>). Select <strong>Leave unbound</strong> in the <strong>App</strong> pull-down, and then click the <strong>Create</strong> button as shown below.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" title=\"Bluemix Updates: Concept Insights Catalog Details\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/useAService_CatalogDetails_annotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix Updates: Concept Insights Catalog Details\" /></p>\n<p><em>NOTE: You can also select the name of an app to use the previously existing capability for app binding.

IBM Containers&#8217; cloud platform approach keeps container processes dedicated to the workload. Best of all, it is ready to go and pre-configured for collecting data.</p>\n<p>Key health metrics such as CPU, Memory, and Network I/O are collected and available to you whether the container is initiated from the IBM Bluemix platform or if you bring your container to the Bluemix platform on the IBM Cloud.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ContainerDetail2b.jpg\" alt=\"Container Detail\" /></p>\n<p>Log events from your Docker log file and from <code>/var/log/messages</code> are also collected and available to you too.</p>\n<h2>Gain insights interacting with your data</h2>\n<p>Interact with your data to gain insights enabling you to more quickly find then fix your application or environment issues. IBM Container monitoring and logging do this in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As shown above, IBM Container health metrics are available, at-a-glance, from your container details page. Select the metric that best conveys the health of that container instance</li>\n<li>Enhance your interaction and insights through our advanced views into the popular open source tools: <a href=\"http://www.elastic.co/products/kibana\">Kibana</a> and <a href=\"http://grafana.org/\">Grafana</a>. Within these tools, you can build insightful dashboards leveraging each tools&#8217; filters and calculation functions to root cause then fix your problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>The integrated monitoring and logging collection and visualization and insight enablement offered today is only the beginning.

It provides secure connectivity from Bluemix to your applications and data sources running on-premise or in other clouds. Version 1.2.0 has some new exciting changes that we hope you will enjoy.</p>\n<p>This release concentrates on the overall user experience and provides the following updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure Gateway for UI updates</li>\n<li>DataPower client support for Enterprise customers</li>\n<li>Security and other enhancements to the Secure Gateway SDK</li>\n<li>Secure Gateway for Bluemix Docker client updates, including client-side TLS support for on-premises connections</li>\n<li>HTTP and HTTPS protocol support</li>\n<li>Additional support for IBM Dataworks and Watson Analytics</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Secure Gateway for UI updates</h2>\n<h3>Secure Gateway configurations</h3>\n<p>In this release we do away with the old style table to show configurations and destinations in favor of a more user-friendly tile format. In the example below, we see the new tiled set of configurations; here we see one newly created configuration.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SecGWUI2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Additional configurations that are created will be displayed in the typical grid pattern across and then down the page. Each tile contains one new information feature and the traditional preferences gear. You will also note the bottom margin details the security that a particular configuration was either created or updated to have. Below is an example of what you will see for you configurations when you click on the information icon in the tile.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SecGWUI1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Secure Gateway destinations</h3>\n<p>Clicking on the preference gear for your gateway, you are presented with a similar interface for your destinations. This has the same tiled look and feel as previously mentioned for configurations. Each indicates whether it is currently enabled or not along with security access information specific for that destination.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SecGWUI3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In the above example, we see the result of clicking on the information icon for a destination. Specific information about the destination&#8217;s configuration— who created them and some time stamps when —are provided. The copy button can be used to copy and paste the value of the Cloud Host and Port for use in your application or command line on the cloud side. The popup is dismissed by click the &#8216;X&#8217; in the upper right hand corner.</p>\n<p>When you create new destinations now you will notice two new protocol types HTTP and HTTPS for on-premises servers and cloud applications that prefer those protocols.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SecGWUI4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Additionally, when creating or editing a destination you will notice a new client-side TLS feature in the Advanced pulldown. By selecting this feature, you enable TLS server-side authentication on the destination. This secures the connection between your Secure Gateway client and your on-premises application using TLS server-side authentication.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ClientTLS1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Secure Gateway for Bluemix DataPower client support</h2>\n<p>In support of enterprise customers, this release of Secure Gateway has client support for DataPower version 7.2. Once you have created your Secure Gateway using the Bluemix UI, you will be given the option select the DataPower client. The DataPower client provides tenant specific support for each Secure Gateway that is created. When you create the gateway additional instructions on how to login to your DataPower and enable the Secure Gateway configuration for your client is provided.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DataPower01.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In the above image, the DataPower client is selected and the instructions to connect client are shown. You are given the option to copy the configuration id into your clipboard as well as continuing to add destinations.</p>\n<h2>Security and enhancements to the Secure Gateway SDK</h2>\n<p>This version also make some minor updates to our SDK support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On-premises client side TLS connections on destination create and update APIs</li>\n<li>A generalized approach to use an &#8216;options&#8217; JSON object for all parameters to minimize interface changes in the future</li>\n<li>Increased security through the use of security token enforcement on gateways and destinations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use the SDK for Secure Gateway, you will now be able to specify client-side TLS when you create or update your destinations. As previously mentioned, this provides added encrypted communication support between your Secure Gateway client and on-premises application.</p>\n<p>The SDK APIs have been generalized so that they no longer require a list of parameters on the actual API calls. Instead, we there is an <code>options</code> JSON object that is defined with all the parameters supported by each API. This will reduce the need to make actual interface changes going forward in favor of just announcing new JSON keys for new functionality.</p>\n<p>The security token (also known as the Java Web Token or jwt) which is generated when you create a Secure Gateway configuration can now be used to enforce extra security on your configurations and destinations. The Secure Gateway UI and SDK provide a new flag that can be set to enforce the use of this security token. Once set, the security token must be used on all connections and other type calls for the gateway configuration or destination. For the Secure Gateway Client, if you fail to provide the security token on a gateway configuration that has this enabled, you will be notified with a message and the connection will fail.</p>\n<h2>Secure Gateway for Bluemix Docker client updates</h2>\n<p>The Secure Gateway Docker client has the following changes:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for on-premises client side TLS connections using server side authentication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New ACL file support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log file and better usage statistics</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>On-premises client side TLS connections</h3>\n<p>The new version of the client now offers on-premises, client-side, TLS server authentication support. With the use of a certificate, it is now possible to encrypt the connection between the Secure Gateway client and the on-premises application using server-side authentication. When creating the destination that requires this encryption, you will select the client-side TLS authentication option on the UI, or similar options using the SDK. Once successfully configured, your connection is fully encrypted between the client and your on-premises application. You can find further details of this support in the Bluemix documentation for Secure Gateway under <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/SecureGateway/index-gentopic3.html#sg_011\">Configuring your client-side TLS connection</a>.</p>\n<h3>New ACL file support</h3>\n<p>One of the strengths of the Secure Gateway is the ability to use an Access Control List (ACL) to allow or deny access for any given connection. In this release, the client now supports defining these in a file that can be loaded. The file is defined as a series of client commands that are read and processed to allow, deny or remove access entries. Entries in the file that are not understood are simply ignored; see the Bluemix documentation for further details.</p>\n<h3>Log file and usage statistics</h3>\n<p>Using either the command line argument or the interactive command you can now specify a log file to collect the console output. Once you specify the log file the contents of the console output is sent to a file in the Docker container&#8217;s <code>/root</code> directory. This can be copied from this location to the hosting machine at any time for analysis using the documented Docker commands. With this capability a user could use a cron job or other mechanism to collect and analyze the client process.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/06/ibm-secure-gateway-updates/","date":"2015-06-23T05:00:55","modified":"2016-12-07T16:34:43","format":"standard","slug":"ibm-secure-gateway-updates","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=17469","excerpt":"<p>The IBM Secure Gateway for Bluemix brings Hybrid Integration capability to your Bluemix environment.

IBM Containers, based on Docker and built on Bluemix, IBM’s platform-as-a-service, provide a more efficient environment that enables faster integration and access to analytics, big data and security services. Enterprises will now be able to use the combination of IBM, Docker, Cloud Foundry and OpenStack to create a new generation of portable distributed applications.</p>\n<p>Also announced today, IBM has become a founding member of a coalition of partners and users to create the Open Container Platform (OCP) that will ensure that containers are interoperable. The creation of the OCP will produce a collaborative environment that fosters the rapid growth of container-based solutions, offering developers a single industry agreed upon approach and direction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our ongoing partnership with IBM has been a great win for the rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups alike that see Docker as the foundation for a new generation of business critical distributed applications,” Nick Stinemates, VP, business development &amp; technical alliances for Docker. “By making a production ready, Docker-based container service, available for developers, IBM is emphasizing a faster time to value and inspiring millions of developers to leverage the growing opportunity of innovating in the cloud.”</p>\n<p>Modern developers need more than basic execution of containers in the cloud. Containers should be empowered with advanced capabilities allowing production applications to be deployed and managed with ease, giving developers the freedom to focus on innovation. The IBM Container service provides significant business benefits to the enterprise that centers on a faster time to market, seamless application portability, higher confidence and reliability for enterprise applications; resulting in an overall reduced development time and cost through a more efficient configuration management across the DevOps value chain.</p>\n<p>IBM Containers accomplish this through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Integrated Tools </i>such as log analytics, performance monitoring and delivery pipeline simplifying life cycle management</li>\n<li><i>Elastic Scaling and Auto Recovery</i> providing resources when needed them most</li>\n<li><i>Zero Downtime Deployments</i> utilizing Active Deploy ensuring users are never impacted by application enhancements</li>\n<li><i>Private Overlays, Load Balancing and Automated Routing</i> enabling capabilities to address even the most complex business requirements</li>\n<li><i>Support for Persistent Storage</i> allowing data-centric application creation</li>\n<li><i>Automated Image Security and Vulnerability Scanning</i> with Vulnerability Advisor alerts to security weaknesses before deployment</li>\n<li><i>Access to Bluemix Services</i>, a powerful catalog of over 100 cloud services including Watson, Analytics, IoT and Mobile</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, IBM has demonstrated Industry’s best performance of Java on Docker. IBM Java is optimized to be two times faster and occupies half the memory when used with the IBM Containers Service. Moreover, as a Docker based service, IBM Containers include open features and interfaces such as the new Docker Compose orchestration services.</p>\n<p>As a unique reseller of the Docker Trusted Registry, IBM is the first to fully integrate the on-premise Docker Trusted Registry software with its flagship DevOPs and Cloud offerings, beginning with IBM UrbanCode and IBM Pure Application Systems. Through this relationship, IBM is again enabling containers for enterprise production workloads in hybrid cloud deployment.</p>\n<p>The DevOps support of IBM Containers enable enterprises to build, automate and orchestrate the deployment of multi-platform, multi-container and traditional workloads together in application environments. Regardless of the phases of the application or delivery pipeline—development, test, staging, production—IBM Containers help move these workloads across various cloud environments with enterprise-class management and security. By working across hybrid clouds and integrating with both on-premises Docker Trusted Registry and cloud-based IBM Container services, developers can easily navigate any cloud development need.</p>\n<p><b>Mindjet taps Bluemix for rapid application development using IBM Containers</b>: Mindjet is a late-stage startup known best for Spigit, a crowdsourcing platform for innovation with hundreds of large enterprise customers and over 4 million users. With annual growth of over 30%, the Spigit team saw operations costs increases and scaling limitations of its existing infrastructure, slowing Mindjet’s pace of innovation and limiting its capacity to add new users.</p>\n<p>Mindjet turned to IBM Cloud for its strong enterprise expertise and cloud services enabling increased innovation for their clients. Using IBM Containers on Bluemix, Mindjet helped its development teams operate more efficiently, innovate with speed, improve engagement and boost productivity; resulting in application deployment times of mere seconds.</p>\n<p>“While we started our application development on Heroku, it wasn’t long before the resulting operations costs started to overtax our team, limiting us in terms of development pace and capabilities,” said James Gardner, CTO at Mindjet. “The agile and open capabilities of IBM’s Bluemix, including the new Docker-based IBM Container services, helped us cut our deployment times to mere seconds and increase our freedom to do what every startup wants to do more of, focus on innovation for our clients.”</p>\n<p>Even though Mindjet evaluated other cloud platforms and providers, including HP; it was IBM’s Bluemix that offered the supercharged scalability required to meet the demands of their enterprise clients. Mindjet also used the IBM Bluemix Garage team to incorporate several DevOps services into their operations achieving seamless integration and controlled production deployment.</p>\n<p>World class support of Docker-based containers is a high priority for enterprise clients who want to leverage containers with production applications. Containers have proved to be effective in a number of enterprises in industries such as financial services, hospitality, retail, healthcare, cloud service providers and others. Many of these large enterprises, as well as startups like Mindjet, worked side-by-side with IBM on the creation of IBM Containers by building and deploying real-world scenarios, which prove containers can be leveraged for enterprise production applications.</p>\n<p>IBM total cloud revenue—covering public, private and hybrid engagements—was $7.7 billion over the previous 12 months at the end of March 2015; it grew more than 60 percent in first quarter 2015. IBM’s cloud delivered as a service business, a subset of the total, includes PaaS offerings such as Bluemix.</p>\n<h2>About Mindjet</h2>\n<p>Mindjet is based in San Francisco, CA with operations in five countries across North America, Europe and Asia, and customers in financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, and technology. Mindjet’s Spigit crowdsourcing software helps companies unleash the power of their employees, partners and customers to drive innovation. Spigit helps companies find the best ideas, execute them, and drive business change for innovation. Spigit customers have driven over $1 billion dollars in incremental revenue and over 200 patents using Spigit.

At the beginning of the year, we <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/01/05/new-exciting-features-liberty-node-js-buildpacks/\">introduced development mode</a>, which enabled users to do <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/eclipsetools/eclipsetools.html#remotedebug\">remote debugging</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/eclipsetools/eclipsetools.html#incrementalpublish\">incremental update</a> against their Liberty applications in Bluemix. Later on we delivered <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/bluemixlive.html#live_sync-edit\">similar support for Node.js applications</a> including nice web dev console for managing the application &#8220;in-place&#8221; (without restarting the application container) and direct shell access into the application container. We are adding equivalent support for Liberty applications in this new version.</p>\n<h2>Enabling app management</h2>\n<p>Previously users can set the <code>ENABLE_BLUEMIX_DEV_MODE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> to turn on the development mode and get all the above fancy utilities together. To give users more control, we are deprecating that environment variable and introducing a new one called <code>BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_ENABLE</code> to extend from development mode to general application management. It can have one or more of the values below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>proxy</code></li>\n<li><code>devconsole</code></li>\n<li><code>shell</code></li>\n<li><code>debug</code></li>\n<li><code>jmx</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Refer to the <em>App Management Utilities Overview</em> in <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2015/06/15/bluemix-node-js-buildpack-update/\">our previous blog on Node.js buildpack v2</a> to find more details on the common utilities like <code>proxy</code>, <code>devcconsole</code> and <code>shell</code> utilities.</p>\n<p>The Liberty-specific <code>debug</code> utility (also turns on the <code>proxy</code> utility) turns the Liberty application into debug mode and allows a remote debug client like the <a href=\"https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ibm-eclipse-tools-bluemix\">IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix</a> to do remote debugging with the application. The <code>jmx</code> utility (does not turn on the <code>proxy</code> utility) enables the <a href=\"https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/was_beta_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/twlp_admin_restconnector.html?cp=was_beta_liberty%2F1-6-1-15-1\">JMX REST Connector</a> to allow a remote JMX client to manage the application using Bluemix user credentials.</p>\n<h2>Accessing the dev console and shell</h2>\n<p>With this new environment variable, you can do <code>cf set-env &lt;your-app&gt; BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_ENABLE devconsole+shell</code> and then <code>cf restart &lt;your_app&gt;</code> to enable the dev console and the shell access. You can use your browser to visit https://&lt;your-app-url&gt;/bluemix-debug/manage to get the dev console, and visit https://&lt;your-app-url&gt;/bluemix-debug/shell to get the shell. See the screenshots below:</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/console.jpg\" alt=\"console\" /><br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shell.jpg\" alt=\"shell\" /></p>\n<p>As an important reminder, these application management utilities only work for singe-instance applications and are meant for development-time usage. You should disable them for production applications by unsetting the <code>BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_ENABLE</code> environment variable. They will still get installed (but not running) by default. If you want to completely remove them, you can set <code>BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_INSTALL</code> to false and do a restage or repush.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/06/liberty-buildpack-app-management-support/","date":"2015-06-16T03:00:50","modified":"2016-12-07T16:34:45","format":"standard","slug":"liberty-buildpack-app-management-support","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=17812","excerpt":"<p>We just pushed out a new version of the Liberty for Java buildpack in Bluemix, version v1.19!

In addition, we have also revamped the App Management feature in the Node.js buildpack, which enables utilities like shell, node-inspector, Bluemix Live Sync, and more!  Simply repush your application to pick up v2.0.</p>\n<p>==============================================</p>\n<p><em>Due to security vulnerabilities, the legacy buildpack is no longer available, and the information about specifying it is outdated.</em></p>\n<p>Note: The legacy buildpack, v1.18, will be available on Bluemix for some time and can be specified using the CF CLI:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">cf push your_app_name &lt;strong&gt;-b sdk-for-nodejs_v1-18-20150519-1759&lt;/strong&gt;</pre>\n<p>Or in your <code>manifest.yml</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">buildpack: &lt;strong&gt;sdk-for-nodejs_v1-18-20150519-1759&lt;/strong&gt;</pre>\n<p>==============================================</p>\n<h2>Community Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Custom NPM versions</strong> — Add the <em>engines.npm </em>entry to your <code>package.json</code> file:\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&quot;engines&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;node&quot;: &quot;0.12.2&quot;,\r\n&lt;strong&gt;    &quot;npm&quot;: &quot;2.7.4&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n},</pre>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Installation of <em>devDependencies</em></strong> — In addition to <em>dependencies</em> in your <code>package.json</code>, set the production flag to false by setting the following application environment variable: <code>NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION false</code></li>\n<li><strong>Configure buildpack caching</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable caching of <code>node_modules</code> entirely by setting <code>NODE_MODULES_CACHE false</code></li>\n<li>Custom cache directories are also available. For example, set the following in your <code>package.json</code> to cache <em>bower_components</em> folder in addition to <code>node_modules</code>:\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&quot;cacheDirectories&quot;: [&quot;node_modules&quot;, &quot;bower_components&quot;]</pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Revamped staging output</strong> — You&#8217;ll find that the staging log is updated, and provides insightful information during staging to how your application is configured (like caching, binary versions and service extensions).  It also provides hints and warnings if you have misconfigured your application.</li>\n<li><strong>Support for simple Node apps</strong> — For running quick node tests, you can push a directory with just a <code>server.js</code> file in it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>App Management on Bluemix</h2>\n<p>App Management is a set of development and management utilities that are enabled via environment variables for your Node.js application on Bluemix.  Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By default, App Management artifacts are installed to your application container, but are not enabled.  To completely disable installation, set the following environment variable and restage your application.\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_INSTALL = false # default is true</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Explicit enablement of the individual App Management utilities &#8212; simply set the following environment variable and restart your application with the <code>cf restart</code> command.\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_ENABLE = devconsole | shell | inspector | trace | proxy</pre>\n<p>Enable multiple utilities by separating utilities with a &#8220;+&#8221;. For example: <code>BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_ENABLE = devconsole+shell+inspector</code></li>\n<li><code>ENABLE_BLUEMIX_DEV_MODE</code> variable is still supported, but deprecated. Enabling it will start the &#8220;proxy+devconsole+shell+inspector&#8221; utilities, as before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a more detailed explanation of all the available utilities, see below!</p>\n<h2>App Management Utilities Overview</h2>\n<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Most App Management utilities will not work if you set your start command in <code>manifest.yml</code> (command) or CF CLI (-c).  Those methods are buildpack overrides, and are anti-patterns for starting Node.js applications.  Recommended practice is to set start command in <code>package.json</code> or <code>Procfile</code>.</p>\n<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Please add 256MB to your application to support installation of the additional utilities.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>proxy</strong>: Minimal application management that serves as a proxy between your application and Bluemix. Allows enablement of most other app management utilities. By enabling this, your application container will continue to live even if the application crashes (granted your start script is properly specified), which is great for checking out the file structure, logs and more. This also allows for incremental file update, which enables &#8220;Live Edit&#8221; feature available through DevOps.</li>\n<li><strong>devconsole</strong> (also starts proxy):  Starts a development console utility which is accessible at <code>http://app_name.mybluemix.net/bluemix-debug/manage</code> (login with your CF credentials)<br />\n<img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image0.png\" alt=\"\" /></li>\n<li><strong>node-inspector</strong> (also starts proxy): Accessible from devconsole, or at <code>http://app_name.mybluemix.net/bluemix-debug/inspector</code>. Create CPU usage profiles, add breakpoints, and debug code, all while your application is running on Bluemix!<br />\n<img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image3.png\" alt=\"\" /></li>\n<li><strong>shell</strong> (also starts proxy). Accessible from the devconsole, or at <code>http://app_name.mybluemix.net/bluemix-debug/shell</code> is a shell running in your application container. You can do everything supported by shell, even editing files while your app is running! Great for debugging.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image2.png\" alt=\"\" /></li>\n<li><b>trace</b> (does NOT start proxy) This feature used to be enabled by default, but is now disabled. <strong>trace</strong> allows you to dynamically set trace levels if your application is using <strong>log4js</strong>, <strong>ibmbluemix</strong> or <strong>bunyan</strong> logging modules.

Tradeoff Analytics was released in Open Beta in February 2015 and received tremendous attention from clients, ecosystem partners and developers. Today, IBM is pleased to announce the Tradeoff Analytics General Availability (GA) release.</p>\n<p>Check out the video!</p>\n<p><!--<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWhRW5TNdGw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>--><br />\n<div data-widget=\"videoplayer\" data-videoid=\"lWhRW5TNdGw\" data-videotype=\"youtube\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWhRW5TNdGw\">Watch the video</a></div></p>\n<h2>The Tradeoff Analytics’ approach for making satisfying decisions</h2>\n<p>What makes consumers satisfied with their selections? What minimizes regrets and returns? In an investment scenario, what contributes to sustainability, to market volatility? What increases the patient’s chances of sticking to a treatment, despite uncomfortable side-effects, and pain? The Tradeoff Analytics tool tackles these questions and more.</p>\n<p>Decision science suggests that when making complex decisions, a thorough examination of the available options can lead to a more qualified judgment. This is exactly where the Tradeoff Analytics tool comes in—it allows you to compare and explore many options against multiple criteria, at the same time. This ultimately contributes to a more balanced decision with optimal payoff.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With Tradeoff Analytics, we focus on creating net new value adds to our software versus spending time on recreating the wheel.<br />\n<cite>John Shelton, CEO, SDWA Ventures</cite></p></blockquote>\n<p>Clients expect to be educated, and empowered: “don’t just tell me what to do”, but “educate me, and let me choose.” Tradeoff Analytics achieves this by providing reasoning and insights that enable judgment through assessment of the alternatives and the consequent results of each choice. The tool identifies alternatives that represent interesting tradeoff considerations. In other words: Tradeoff Analytics highlights areas where you may compromise a little to gain a lot. For example, in a scenario where you want to buy a phone, you can learn that if you pay just a little more for one phone, you will gain a better camera and a better battery life, which can give you greater satisfaction than the slightly lower price.</p>\n<p>The service structure is twofold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tradeoff Analytics uses mathematical filtering to narrow results to the most optimal. This lets you focus on the top options without the clutter.</li>\n<li>It then uses various analytical and visual approaches to help you explore the tradeoffs between these options. You can add and remove objectives and see what makes it to the optimal set and why. You can prioritize according to your personal preference to emphasize certain values or objectives. Tradeoff Analytics will guide you with “did you know” kind of insights so that you will never miss out on those options that best meet your needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More details about Tradeoff Analytics, the science behind it, how to use the APIs, and example applications are available <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tradeoff-analytics.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/tradeoff-analytics/\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>. Interact with the visualization capability by clicking on “Analyze Sample Data” in the easy to use <a href=\"http://tradeoff-analytics-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a>.</p>\n<h2>IBM Watson Tradeoff Analytics Updates since Beta</h2>\n<p>We worked with clients and partners to bring you these updates since beta:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Categorical and date/time values</b> &#8211; This version expands beyond our support for numerical objective values. To understand the significance of this change, consider the phones selection example that was discussed before. In this example, the brand of the phone is a categorical value. With this feature, the Tradeoff Analytics service enables editing the order (the prioritization) of the brands. The date / time data type is very useful when there is a preference for it, for example when you want to select the newest house, or want to select the nearest doctor’s appointment. This feature also allows for filtering them in new UI components like in this screen:<br />\n<img style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray;\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/watson_tradeoff_analytics_screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" /></li>\n<li><b>New Language support</b> &#8211; The new Tradeoff Analytics version also supports nine more languages on top of English: German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Chinese, and Chinese Taiwan.</li>\n<li><b>More client library customization</b> – There was already feature and style customization, but now developers have control over different events that happen during the decision process. This enables them to tap in at different stages of that process, and input custom behaviors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pricing and Freemium Tier</h2>\n<p>Trial Bluemix accounts remain free. Please visit www.bluemix.net to register, and get free instant access to a 30-day trial without a credit card. Use of the Tradeoff Analytics service is free during this trial period. After the trial period, you will be charged at a rate of 3 cents per API call with 1000 API calls per month free.</p>\n<h2>Transition Plan</h2>\n<p>We look forward to continuing our partnership with the many clients, business partners, and creative developers that have built innovative applications using the beta version of the Tradeoff Analytics service. If you have done so, please migrate your applications to use the GA service in the next 30 days (by June 28, 2015), after which the beta Tradeoff Analytics service will no longer be available. See the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/tradeoff-analytics/upgrade.shtml#migrating\" target=\"_blank\">documentation for migrating applications</a> from beta to GA.</p>\n<p>We’re eager to see what the next round of cognitive applications based on Tradeoff Analytics look like.

Here is a summary of the key new features and improvements made since the March update.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Java 8</b>. It is now possible to test and run your applications in Bluemix with Java 8. IBM JRE 7.1 remains the default, but you can enable Java 8 simply by setting an environment variable via a <code>manifest.yml</code> file or using the <code>cf</code> command line client. For example, to use the latest IBM JRE 8 on your application, execute the following command and restage your application:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$ cf set-env myApp JBP_CONFIG_IBMJDK &quot;version: 1.8.+&quot;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Similarly, it is possible to enable and specify the version of OpenJDK. See <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#customizingjre\">Customizing the JRE</a> for details.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Liberty profile</b>. We have updated the version of the Liberty profile server based on the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2015/04/10/announcing-liberty-beta-with-tools-aprilmay-2015/\">April beta</a>. With this update, the <i>jsp-2.3</i>, <i>el-3.0</i>, and <i>jdbc-4.1</i> Liberty features, previously available as beta features, are now available as production-ready features. Also, additional Java EE 7 features such as <i>jsf-2.2</i>, <i>javaMail-1.5</i>, <i>webProfile-7.0</i>, and <i>javaee-7.0</i> are now available as <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#libertybeta\">beta features</a>.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Feature overrides</b>. When deploying a WAR or EAR file, the buildpack generates a Liberty configuration file with a default set of features enabled. In the latest buildpack, we introduced a way to override the set of features via an environment variable. For example, to enable <i>websocket-1.1</i> and <i>jdbc-4.1</i> features only, set the following environment variable in your <code>manifest.yml</code> file before pushing your application:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nenv:\r\n  JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY 'app_archive: {features: [websocket-1.1, jdbc-4.1]}'</pre>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#optionsforpushinglibertyapplications\">Stand-alone Applications</a> for more information.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Context root</b>. When deploying a WAR file, the buildpack now looks for the embedded <code>WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml</code> file and the <code>context-root</code> property set in it. If the file exists and the property is set, the buildpack uses it as the application&#8217;s context root. Otherwise, the application will be available under the root context as before. Please note that with this change, some applications that were previously deployed under the root context might be deployed under a different context based on the settings in the <code>ibm-web-ext.xml</code> file.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Security fixes.</b> In the second April release of the buildpack, we have updated the IBM JRE 7.1-2.11 with a security fix for the <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21882777\">Bar Mitzvah vulnerability</a>.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>User-defined services.</b> We have enhanced the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/liberty/index.html#automaticconfigurationofboundservices\">automatic configuration feature</a> to work with user-defined services.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we have updated the data collector and reduced the amount of logs generated for the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/monana/index.html\">Monitoring and Analytics Service</a>. We have also updated the WebSphere eXtreme Scale Client to pick up the latest fixes and improvements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have changed how the application files are laid out in the droplet, in order to reduce complexity related to maintaining symbolic links. This should have no impact on applications as the droplet structure is considered an implementation detail of the buildpack and should not be relied upon.</p>\n<p>The latest buildpack version is <code>v1.17-20150501-1729</code>.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/05/liberty-buildpack-updates-java-8-java-ee-7-updates/","date":"2015-05-05T15:51:22","modified":"2017-01-11T04:50:23","format":"standard","slug":"liberty-buildpack-updates-java-8-java-ee-7-updates","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=13866","excerpt":"<p>Since the last blog post on the Liberty buildpack update in March, we have released three additional buildpack updates.

This is a major benefit of the cloud and one of the many reasons why there is a rush to ‘as-a-service’ solutions.</p>\n<p>Since we are able to continuously build out dashDB&mdash; as more and more users are using our dashDB data warehouse &mdash;we are continuously developing new features and interfaces based on user feedback.</p>\n<h3>New Larger Service Offerings</h3>\n<p>We have added two additional levels of offerings for our dashDB Enterprise to support larger amounts of data: <b>4TB</b> and <b>12TB</b>. These offerings still maintain dashDB’s managed service experience – cloud data warehouse with in-database analytics.</p>\n<p>These dashDB Enterprise offerings will be available for both the public IBM Bluemix cloud as well as IBM Bluemix Dedicated environments. Bluemix Dedicated brings new levels of control, security, and flexibility to cloud-based application development. We now enable Bluemix Dedicated users to realize the benefits of data warehousing and analytics in a<br />\ntruly single-tenant cloud environment while maintaining all of the values associated with IBM Bluemix, such as composable services and time to value.</p>\n<p>For more information on Bluemix and getting started, <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/?ace_base=true/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store&#038;serviceOfferingGuid=7c87c148-e1a4-4cb8-81f8-c5e74be7684b&#038;fromCatalog=true\" title=\"dashDB in Bluemix\" target=\"_blank\">visit dashDB in the Bluemix Catalog</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information on what Bluemix Dedicated is, check out this video:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Xp9hYIUNr8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3>Expanding and Enhancing Access to Data</h3>\n<p>In addition, with our release on February 12th, 2015 we have added a number of new ways to interface and interact with dashDB:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Apple Mac OS Access</i>: As a Mac user I’m very excited to now have an OS X version of the dashDB driver package. This OS X package provides a graphical interface to quickly install drivers that are required to connect to the data warehouse service. Installing the package is as easy as clicking on the Set Up → Connect Applications page from the dashDB web-based console.</li>\n<li><i>SSL Connections Get Simpler</i>: dashDB now uses a digital certificate that is issued by a third party for secure socket layer (SSL) connections. The certificate authority (CA) from the issuer is now a part of the dashDB driver package. If you install the latest dashDB driver package, you do not need to download a separate SSL certificate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you already have SSL connections in place you will need to reconfigure with the new CA certificate. For more information on two ways to do this, please refer to the <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6NHC/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.doc/connecting/connect_secure_connections_ssl.html\" title=\"dashDB technical update\" target=\"_blank\">recent technical update</a>.</p>\n<p>More in-depth information on the specifics of the latest dashDB driver package, see <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6NHC/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.doc/whats_new.html\">What&#8217;s New &ndash; IBM Knowledge Center</a>. In addition to the connection updates, the team has also incorporated a number of console enhancements and function updates – such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In-database analytic models are now supported as an object type. You can view the models, edit the properties, and copy the models</li>\n<li>Ability to create and run multiple SQL commands or user scripts in the dashDB web console. The SQL editor features a syntax content assistant, query parsing, and syntax validation to help you craft SQL statements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And as always, we are continuously adding more build in analytic algorithms based on our user demands. Two of the latest are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>idaKMeans</code> &#8211; A new R function for dashDB that implements the k-means clustering algorithm.</li>\n<li><code>idaNaiveBayes</code> &#8211; A new R function for dashDB that implements the naive Bayes prediction algorithm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cloud is offering us a unique opportunity to collaborate with our customers and data warehousing community to innovate solutions that are revolutionizing the way that organizations tap into and leverage data.</p>\n<p>If you doubt me, go ahead and try for your self – <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/?ace_base=true/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store&#038;serviceOfferingGuid=7c87c148-e1a4-4cb8-81f8-c5e74be7684b&#038;fromCatalog=true\" title=\"dashDB free to use under 1GB\" target=\"_blank\">dashDB is free to use under 1GB of data storage</a>.

With each release of the buildpack we introduce new features, improve existing features or provide important fixes. Here are the key changes we have made since the start of the year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>JRebel integration:</strong> <a href=\"http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/\">ZeroTurnaround&#8217;s JRebel</a> is a tool that lets you perform instant updates on your application without redeploying or restarting the application. It saves countless hours and minutes waiting for the redeploy or restart to happen. We have enhanced the Liberty buildpack to integrate with JRebel to have the same instant update experience whether you are updating the application running on your workstation or running remotely on Bluemix. Currently, only stand-alone web applications are supported.</li>\n<li><strong>Liberty profile:</strong> We have updated version of the Liberty profile server based on the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2015/02/13/announcing-liberty-beta-tools-february-2015/\">February beta</a>. The new version of the Liberty profile server makes possible to preview and try out the upcoming Java EE 7 features directly in Bluemix. The new features include <em>cdi-1.2</em>, <em>el-3.0</em>, <em>jca-1.7</em> or <em>jsp-2.3</em>. To use these features in Bluemix see <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/liberty/index.html#libertybeta\">using beta features</a> for more information.</li>\n<li><strong>Security fixes:</strong> The latest buildpack contains an updated IBM JRE 7.1.2.11 with a <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21699864\">security fix for the FREAK vulnerability</a>. We also have addressed the <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696864\">Apache HttpComponents and Java overlay feature vulnerabilities</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>SQL Database service plugin</strong>: The <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/SQLDB/index.html\">SQL Database service</a> offers paid plans that provide an option for connecting with the database server over the SSL protocol. We have updated the Liberty buildpack to configure the runtime to connect with the database over SSL if the SSL connection information is available. Currently, the <em>small</em> and <em>premium</em> plans provide the SSL connection information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, to pick up the latest fixes and improvements, we have updated the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Auto-Scaling/index.html\">Auto-Scaling service</a> agent and the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/monana/index.html\">Monitoring and Analytics service</a> data collector. We have upgraded the WebSphere eXtreme Scale Client to version 8.6.0.6. Also, we have improved the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/liberty/index.html#automaticconfigurationofboundservices__newrelic\">New Relic service</a> integration to support user-defined services.</p>\n<p>The latest Liberty Buildpack version is <code>v1.14-20150319-1159</code>.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/03/liberty-buildpack-updates-jrebel-security-improvements/","date":"2015-03-24T16:28:49","modified":"2016-12-07T16:35:26","format":"standard","slug":"liberty-buildpack-updates-jrebel-security-improvements","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=11407","excerpt":"<p>Since the beginning of the year, we have updated the Liberty buildpack a number of times.

If so, this scenario is probably very familiar to you: You make a small code change, then wait patiently for a full redeploy of your app so that you can test it. This workflow works great in a local development environment, with tooling like incremental build and hot code swap&#8230; But thus far, it has been difficult to make this workflow fast and efficient using a cloud runtime as your execution environment.</p>\n<p>Well, what if you could develop applications running on Bluemix <em>as if you were in a local environment</em>? What if, the minute you press save in your text editor of choice, your code automatically syncs with your Web IDE workspace and incrementally deploys to your running Bluemix app instance, enabling a wonderfully efficient code-test cycle? Bluemix Live Sync lets you do just that!</p>\n<p>Bluemix Live Sync has three key capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Desktop Sync:</strong> Synchronize a desktop directory tree with a project workspace that is used by the Web IDE — changes made in one place immediately appear in the other.</li>\n<li><strong>Live Edit:</strong> Deploy a Node.js application so that any changes you make to a project workspace, whether from a synchronized desktop directory tree or via the Web IDE, are instantly propagated to the application&#8217;s file system.</li>\n<li><strong>Debug:</strong> For Node.js applications, restart, get shell access, and use the Node Inspector debugger.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img  src=\"http://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2015/02/live-edit-webide-1024x639.png\" alt=\"Live Edit mode ON in the Web IDE\" /></p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re working with an app running on Bluemix, sometimes you&#8217;re making sweeping changes to your code and you want to guarantee a &#8220;fresh start&#8221;. So, you completely redeploy your app using Build &amp; Deploy, the Cloud Foundry CLI, or the Web IDE. But other times, you&#8217;re just making minor changes like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing a particular function</li>\n<li>Modifying one of the messages that is displayed</li>\n<li>Updating fonts and colors</li>\n<li>Replacing images</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full redeployment for simple changes like this can be aggravating because you can spend more time waiting for the deployment to complete than it took to make the change. To avoid this, you probably set up a local environment, especially for web applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you need to change an image or a CSS file, you simply make the change in your local environment and refresh your browser.</li>\n<li>Even if the change you want to make needs a server restart, killing the process and restarting it is pretty fast.</li>\n<li>You can use Node Inspector to debug Node.js applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, getting your code to run in your local environment isn&#8217;t &#8220;free&#8221;. You need to install all the prerequisites that your app needs, such as Node.js, and then provide access to, or stub, the services your app depends on, and more, all of which can consume a lot of time.</p>\n<p>Now, you have an alternative. Bluemix Live Sync allows you to work in the Web IDE or in a local text editor, and have your code automatically sync with your app instance running in Bluemix, enabling that rapid iteration workflow that you&#8217;ve already dreamed could be possible in the cloud!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2015/02/bluemix-live-cli-and-sublime.png\" alt=\"Bluemix Live command line interface with Sublime\" /></p>\n<p>Use the Bluemix Debugger for node.js:</p>\n<p><img  src=\"http://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2015/02/bluemix-debug-for-nodejs.png\" alt=\"Bluemix debug for Node.js\" /></p>\n<p>&#8230; to launch the Node inspector:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2015/02/bluemix-debug-node-inspector.png\" alt=\"Bluemix debug node inspector\" /></p>\n<p>&#8230; or access the debug shell:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-757\" src=\"http://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2015/02/bluemix-debug-shell.png\" alt=\"Bluemix debug shell\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see how much more quickly you can work. In many cases, it just won&#8217;t be worth setting up a local runtime environment anymore.</p>\n<p>So far, we have delivered first class support for Node.js and Java runtimes, but there is much more to come!

Available now, you can access the following free beta services on Bluemix:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Speech to Text\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html\">Speech to Text</a></li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Text to Speech\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html\">Text to Speech</a></li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Visual Recognition\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html\">Visual Recognition</a></li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Concept Insights\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/concept-insights.html\">Concept Insights</a></li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tradeoff Analytics\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tradeoff-analytics.html\">Tradeoff Analytics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ve included an overview of each service below. Our team will continue to add more services in the Watson Developer Cloud as they become available. Stay tuned.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/watson/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/02/New-services-e1422814890751.png\" alt=\"New services\" /></p>\n<h3>Speech to Text</h3>\n<p>Speech to Text is a cloud-based, real-time service that uses low latency speech recognition capabilities to convert speech into text for voice-controlled mobile applications, transcription services, and more. Transcriptions are continuously sent back to the client, and retroactively corrected as more speech is heard, helping the system learn.</p>\n<p>The service is based on more than 50 years of speech research at IBM. It uses state-of-the-art algorithms based on convolutional neural networks or &#8220;deep learning&#8221;. Using these algorithms, the Watson team has <a title=\"published the best accuracy results\" href=\"http://www.mirlab.org/conference_papers/International_Conference/ICASSP 2014/papers/p5609-soltau.pdf \" target=\"_blank\">published the best accuracy results</a> (10.4% word error rate vs. 12.5% for the second best as of today) on the popular Switchboard Hub5-2000 benchmark, and provided technology that has been deployed on more than 500 million smartphones. This is the first time in 10 years that the IBM team is delivering speech technology broadly to developers. While the base algorithms are solid, the service will keep getting better as it gets more usage and training data.</p>\n<p>Use Cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable voice control over apps, embedded devices or accessories</li>\n<li>Provide transcription of meetings and conference calls in real-time</li>\n<li>Critical building block for “Speech-to-Speech” translation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://speech-to-text-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Speech to Text Demo</a></p>\n<p></span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/speech-to-text/\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<h3>Text to Speech</h3>\n<p>Text to Speech converts textual input into speech, and provides the option of three voices in English or Spanish, including the American English voice used by Watson in the 2011 Jeopardy match.  Text to Speech generates synthesized audio output complete with appropriate cadence and intonation. The user can input any English or Spanish text to generate speech output, a service that has potential applications for the vision-impaired, as reading-based education tools and for multiple mobile apps.</p>\n<p>Use Cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assistance for the vision-impaired, reading and language education</li>\n<li>Enable the audio reading of texts and emails to drivers</li>\n<li>Critical building block for “Speech-to-Speech” translation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://text-to-speech-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Text to Speech Demo</a></p>\n<p></span> <span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/text-to-speech/\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<h3>Visual Recognition</h3>\n<p>Visual Recognition analyzes the visual appearance of images or video frames to understand what is happening in a scene.</p>\n<p>The Visual Recognition service includes an unmatched number of preset classifier and trained labels (2,000+), a taxonomy that recognizes 150+ different sports, and can ingest 1,000+ batch images with the ability to recognize multiple labels in a picture. Like the Speech to Text service, Visual Recognition relies on deep learning. Convolutional neural networks are used as semantic classifiers that recognize many visual entities such as settings, objects, and events. Input JPEG images into the service and you will receive a set of labels and probability scores such as such as “soccer, 0.7” or “baseball, 0.3”.</p>\n<p>Use Cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organize and ingest large collections of digital images</li>\n<li>Build semantic association between images from multiple users</li>\n<li>Understand consumer shopping preferences based on image queries</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://visual-recognition-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Recognition Demo</a></p>\n<p></span> <span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/visual-recognition/\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<h3>Concept Insights</h3>\n<p>Concept Insights handles text in a conceptual way, delivering a search capability that discovers new insights on text compared to traditional keyword searches.</p>\n<p>Concept Insights links user-provided documents with a pre-existing graph of concepts based on Wikipedia (e.g. &#8216;The New York Times&#8217;, &#8216;Machine learning&#8217;, etc.). Two types of links are identified: explicit links when a document directly mentions a concept, and implicit links which connect the user’s documents to relevant concepts that are not directly mentioned. Users of this service can also search for documents that are relevant to a concept or collection of concepts by exploring the explicit and implicit links.</p>\n<p>Use Cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve search queries with results that are more conceptually related</li>\n<li>Locate sources of expertise across large or complex organizations</li>\n<li>Deepen customer engagement by returning more relevant information</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://concept-insights-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Concept Insights Demo</a></p>\n<p></span> <span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/concept-insights/\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<h3>Tradeoff Analytics</h3>\n<p>Tradeoff Analytics enables dynamic real-time ‘tradeoff’ decisions across static or changing parameters, all delivered in an interactive visual display. Tradeoff Analytics enables better decision-making by dynamically weighing multiple, often conflicting, goals. This service uses Pareto filtering techniques to identify the optimal alternatives across multiple criteria. It then uses various analytical and visual approaches to help the decision maker explore tradeoffs and alternatives.</p>\n<p>Tradeoff Analytics can be used to help make complex decisions like what mortgage to take, which treatment option to follow, what car to purchase.</p>\n<p>Use Cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable retailers and manufacturers to determine product mix</li>\n<li>Allow consumers to compare and contrast competitive products or services</li>\n<li>Help physicians select optimal treatment options based on multiple criteria</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://tradeoff-analytics-demo.mybluemix.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Tradeoff Analytics Demo</a></p>\n<p></span> <span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/tradeoff-analytics/\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a></p>\n<p></span></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/02/five-new-services-expand-ibm-watson-capabilities-images-speech/","date":"2015-02-05T13:38:11","modified":"2016-12-07T16:35:29","format":"standard","slug":"five-new-services-expand-ibm-watson-capabilities-images-speech","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=9065","excerpt":"<p>Since its launch, you’ve made the IBM Watson Developer Cloud one of IBM’s most vibrant and innovative communities on Bluemix.

Two major features of this update are remote application debug and incremental publish of J2EE applications. These additions make application development in Bluemix easier than ever.</p>\n<p>Below are the highlighted capabilities introduced in this update:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remote debug applications that are running in Bluemix</strong><br />\n A remote application debug capability has been introduced for J2EE applications and Liberty servers that are published from the tools. After an application has been deployed to Bluemix, you can right click on the application in the <em>Servers</em> view and select <em>Enable Application Debug</em>. The application will be restarted in debug mode so that you can debug the selected application directly from Eclipse.<br />\n<img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/12/debugApp.png\" alt=\"Remote debug applications that are running in Bluemix\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n<li> <strong>Incremental publish of application in Bluemix</strong><br />\nIn the past, a single line of code change required the entire application to be redeployed. With the introduction of incremental publish support, the tools can now publish only the changed files to Bluemix and the changes will take place immediately without a redeploy of the entire application. After an application has been deployed to Bluemix, you can right clicking on the application from the <em>Servers</em> view and select <em>Enable Development Mode</em>. When the application is running in Development Mode, you can incrementally publish your application to the Bluemix server just as if you are doing local development. You just need to push the <em>Publish</em> button and the magic will happen!<br />\n<img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/12/incrementalPublishApp.png\" alt=\"Incremental publish of application in Bluemix\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li> <strong>Run on Server for JavaScript files</strong><br />\nAfter a JavaScript application has been deployed to Bluemix, you can now choose a different entry point JavaScript file by right clicking on the file > <em>Run As > Run on Server</em>.  The application will be removed from the server and re-installed with the selected file as the entry point JavaScript file.  In addition, the browser will automatically launch to run the entry point JavaScript file after the application has started.<br />\n<img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/09/RunOnServer.png\" alt=\"RunOnServer\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li> <strong>Remove unused routes</strong><br />\nWhen an application is published to Bluemix, a route is automatically created for you.  A new <em>Remove</em> button has been added under the Routes section on the Applications and Services page on the server editor to allow you to find and delete unused routes.<br />\n<img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/09/deleteRoutes.png\" alt=\"Remove unused routes\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to adding new functions, we have also included a number of bug fixes in this version.</p>\n<p>If you are new to the IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix or you want to find out more about them, you can find more information below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/2014/06/30/announcing-ibm-eclipse-tools-bluemix/\" title=\"Announcing: IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix\">IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix announcement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/eclipsetools/eclipsetools.html#eclipsetools\">Product documentation</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-IBM_Eclipse_Tools_for_Bluemix\" target=\"_blank\">Get it now!</a></p>\n<p></span><span class=\"pls\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"/wasdev/answers\" target=\"_blank\">Give feedback on dWAnswers</a></p>\n<p></span></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/01/updates-ibm-eclipse-tools-for-bluemix/","date":"2015-01-05T12:43:04","modified":"2016-12-07T16:35:49","format":"standard","slug":"updates-ibm-eclipse-tools-for-bluemix","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=7987","excerpt":"<p>The latest IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix is now available for download.

Below is the highlight of the new features in these releases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Development mode support in Eclipse</b> &mdash; development mode is a special mode which allows developers to conduct many activities for an application instance that were not possible before. By exploiting this feature, the latest <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix\" href=\"http://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/eclipsetools/eclipsetools.html#eclipsetools\">IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix</a> can now support remote debugging with incremental file updates against a Liberty application running in Bluemix. This makes it convenient for a developer using Eclipse to debug an application in the cloud and apply changes to that application instantly. We will provide more interesting features with development mode in the future. The development mode is introduced in our latest Liberty buildpack v1.10-20141218-0103</li>\n<li><b>Dynamic log level setting for Node.js</b> &mdash; currently Java developers can change the Liberty runtime and the application’s trace specification dynamically from the Bluemix Console without restarting the application. Developers can also trigger Java dumps and create snap traces. These features make it easier to diagnose application problems.  Now we are extending the dynamic log setting support to Node.js applications. With this, developers can change the log level of their application on the fly if the application is using log4js, bunyan or ibmbluemix modules for logging.</li>\n<li><strong>New Liberty and Node.js runtimes</strong> &mdash; we release the latest version of the Liberty and Node.js runtimes as they become available every month. In the most recent Liberty v2014.12.0.0 version, four Java EE 7 features were released: concurrent-1.0, jsonp-1.0, servlet-3.1, and websocket-1.0. Developers can now use these production-ready features by <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"pushing a Liberty server package\" href=\"http://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/?cm_mmc=developerWorks-_-dWdevcenter-_-bluemix-_-lp#starters/liberty/index.html#optionsforpushinglibertyapplications\">pushing a Liberty server package</a>. The latest IBM SDK for Node.js runtime was also made available in Bluemix, which is based on the open source Node.js v0.10.33.\n<p>Both runtimes also contain fixes for the POODLE issue. <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"The fix for Liberty applications\" href=\"https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688170\">The fix for Liberty applications</a> was first introduced in buildpack v1.8-20141118-1610. <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"The fix for Node.js applications\" href=\"https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688045\">The fix for Node.js applications</a> was first available in v0.10.33 of the runtime.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced JVM option support</strong> &mdash; here are two enhancements made to the JVM option support in the Liberty buildpack. First, there is now uniform support to change JVM options just by doing a restart. Second, the default JVM options are optimized for fast failure and pre-configured with a common location that makes it easy to find the generated dumps.

Contact your IBM Information Sales representative to purchase.</li>\n<li><b>Higher capacity, paid usage plans</b> &#8211; We’re not taking away the freemium offering for data usage below 1 GB, but we are adding an Entry plan that is fully integrated with Cloudant supporting up to 50 GB of uncompressed data, for only $50/month.</li>\n<li><b>Expanded geographic presence</b> &#8211; dashDB can now be deployed in our UK availability region in addition to our existing North American regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New and Useful Features</h3>\n<p>We heard you during the beta program&mdash;dashDB is very cool, but there are some things you need to make it even more useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Improved SQL Editor</b> &#8211; We’ve expanded our SQL query and editor capabilities to allow a full range of SQL to be submitted via the web browser, including the ability to load and save SQL scripts.  SQL validation and error checking is also included.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/run-sql-scripts2.png\" alt=\"Run SQL Scripts\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" />\n</li>\n<li><b>Better Workload Monitoring</b> &#8211; You can now get a much better idea of what’s running in your dashDB instance, ranging from specific statements to connections.  Set it to monitor in near real-time and drill down to the details of a session, or terminate it if needed.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/monitor-workloads2.png\" alt=\"Monitor Workloads\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" />\n</li>\n<li><b>Command Line Support</b> &#8211; Sometimes, all we really want is a good command-line interface. We’re pleased to introduce CLPPlus support for dashDB.  CLPPlus is a command line user interface that can be used to connect to databases and define, edit, and run statements, scripts, and commands.  (No screenshot here, because as cool as command line is, it doesn’t make for an interesting visual!)</li>\n<li><b>UDX Support</b> &#8211; Sometimes applications or algorithms require something very special&#8230; something that we might not have provided out of the box.  dashDB now supports user-defined functions (UDFs) and user-defined aggregates (UDAs) to let you implement your own algorithms and have them run inside the database.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Security Features and Capabilities</h3>\n<p>You can’t embrace cloud without embracing security too, and dashDB is no stranger to the challenges of security in the cloud.  Here are some new security features in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>SSL Support for all Connections</b> &#8211; It’s not enough to automatically encrypt data at rest, we need to encrypt it in motion too.  dashDB now supports SSL for all connections to the database<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ibm-dashdb2.png\" alt=\"IBM dashDB\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" />\n</li>\n<li><b>Select Guardium Reports for all Plans</b> &#8211; dashDB now includes bundled Guardium reports for all plans including the Enterprise and Cloudant integrated plans.  This allows automatic discovery of sensitive data, as well as access reports and details of SQL statements that were run against that data.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sensitive-data-report2.png\" alt=\"Sensitive Data Report\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" />\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In true cloud form, we’ll continue to add new features and capabilities to dashDB over the coming months, so keep on watching because great things are ahead!

Two major features of this update are remote application debug and incremental publish of J2EE applications. These additions make application development in Bluemix easier than ever.</p>\n<p>Below are the highlighted capabilities introduced in this update:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remote debug applications that are running in Bluemix</strong><br />\n A remote application debug capability has been introduced for J2EE applications and Liberty servers that are published from the tools. After an application has been deployed to Bluemix, you can right click on the application in the <em>Servers</em> view and select <em>Enable Application Debug</em>. The application will be restarted in debug mode so that you can debug the selected application directly from Eclipse.<br />\n<img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/12/debugApp.png\" alt=\"Remote debug applications that are running in Bluemix\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n<li> <strong>Incremental publish of application in Bluemix</strong><br />\nIn the past, a single line of code change required the entire application to be redeployed. With the introduction of incremental publish support, the tools can now publish only the changed files to Bluemix and the changes will take place immediately without a redeploy of the entire application. After an application has been deployed to Bluemix, you can right clicking on the application from the <em>Servers</em> view and select <em>Enable Development Mode</em>. When the application is running in Development Mode, you can incrementally publish your application to the Bluemix server just as if you are doing local development. You just need to push the <em>Publish</em> button and the magic will happen!<br />\n<img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/12/incrementalPublishApp.png\" alt=\"Incremental publish of application in Bluemix\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li> <strong>Run on Server for JavaScript files</strong><br />\nAfter a JavaScript application has been deployed to Bluemix, you can now choose a different entry point JavaScript file by right clicking on the file > <em>Run As > Run on Server</em>.  The application will be removed from the server and re-installed with the selected file as the entry point JavaScript file.  In addition, the browser will automatically launch to run the entry point JavaScript file after the application has started.<br />\n<img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/09/RunOnServer.png\" alt=\"RunOnServer\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li> <strong>Remove unused routes</strong><br />\nWhen an application is published to Bluemix, a route is automatically created for you.  A new <em>Remove</em> button has been added under the Routes section on the Applications and Services page on the server editor to allow you to find and delete unused routes.<br />\n<img src=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/09/deleteRoutes.png\" alt=\"Remove unused routes\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to adding new functions, we have also included a number of bug fixes in this version.</p>\n<p>If you are new to the IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix or you want to find out more about them, you can find more information below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/2014/06/30/announcing-ibm-eclipse-tools-bluemix/\" title=\"Announcing: IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix\">IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix announcement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/eclipsetools/eclipsetools.html#eclipsetools\">Product documentation</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"prs\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-IBM_Eclipse_Tools_for_Bluemix\" target=\"_blank\">Get it now!</a></p>\n<p></span><span class=\"pls\">\n<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-blue-50\" href=\"/wasdev/answers\" target=\"_blank\">Give feedback on dWAnswers</a></p>\n<p></span></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/01/updates-ibm-eclipse-tools-for-bluemix/","date":"2015-01-05T12:43:04","modified":"2016-12-07T16:35:49","format":"standard","slug":"updates-ibm-eclipse-tools-for-bluemix","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=7987","excerpt":"<p>The latest IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix is now available for download.

Below is the highlight of the new features in these releases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Development mode support in Eclipse</b> &mdash; development mode is a special mode which allows developers to conduct many activities for an application instance that were not possible before. By exploiting this feature, the latest <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix\" href=\"http://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/eclipsetools/eclipsetools.html#eclipsetools\">IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix</a> can now support remote debugging with incremental file updates against a Liberty application running in Bluemix. This makes it convenient for a developer using Eclipse to debug an application in the cloud and apply changes to that application instantly. We will provide more interesting features with development mode in the future. The development mode is introduced in our latest Liberty buildpack v1.10-20141218-0103</li>\n<li><b>Dynamic log level setting for Node.js</b> &mdash; currently Java developers can change the Liberty runtime and the application’s trace specification dynamically from the Bluemix Console without restarting the application. Developers can also trigger Java dumps and create snap traces. These features make it easier to diagnose application problems.  Now we are extending the dynamic log setting support to Node.js applications. With this, developers can change the log level of their application on the fly if the application is using log4js, bunyan or ibmbluemix modules for logging.</li>\n<li><strong>New Liberty and Node.js runtimes</strong> &mdash; we release the latest version of the Liberty and Node.js runtimes as they become available every month. In the most recent Liberty v2014.12.0.0 version, four Java EE 7 features were released: concurrent-1.0, jsonp-1.0, servlet-3.1, and websocket-1.0. Developers can now use these production-ready features by <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"pushing a Liberty server package\" href=\"http://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/?cm_mmc=developerWorks-_-dWdevcenter-_-bluemix-_-lp#starters/liberty/index.html#optionsforpushinglibertyapplications\">pushing a Liberty server package</a>. The latest IBM SDK for Node.js runtime was also made available in Bluemix, which is based on the open source Node.js v0.10.33.\n<p>Both runtimes also contain fixes for the POODLE issue. <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"The fix for Liberty applications\" href=\"https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688170\">The fix for Liberty applications</a> was first introduced in buildpack v1.8-20141118-1610. <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"The fix for Node.js applications\" href=\"https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688045\">The fix for Node.js applications</a> was first available in v0.10.33 of the runtime.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced JVM option support</strong> &mdash; here are two enhancements made to the JVM option support in the Liberty buildpack. First, there is now uniform support to change JVM options just by doing a restart. Second, the default JVM options are optimized for fast failure and pre-configured with a common location that makes it easy to find the generated dumps.

Contact your IBM Information Sales representative to purchase.</li>\n<li><b>Higher capacity, paid usage plans</b> &#8211; We’re not taking away the freemium offering for data usage below 1 GB, but we are adding an Entry plan that is fully integrated with Cloudant supporting up to 50 GB of uncompressed data, for only $50/month.</li>\n<li><b>Expanded geographic presence</b> &#8211; dashDB can now be deployed in our UK availability region in addition to our existing North American regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New and Useful Features</h3>\n<p>We heard you during the beta program&mdash;dashDB is very cool, but there are some things you need to make it even more useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Improved SQL Editor</b> &#8211; We’ve expanded our SQL query and editor capabilities to allow a full range of SQL to be submitted via the web browser, including the ability to load and save SQL scripts.  SQL validation and error checking is also included.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/run-sql-scripts2.png\" alt=\"Run SQL Scripts\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" />\n</li>\n<li><b>Better Workload Monitoring</b> &#8211; You can now get a much better idea of what’s running in your dashDB instance, ranging from specific statements to connections.  Set it to monitor in near real-time and drill down to the details of a session, or terminate it if needed.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/monitor-workloads2.png\" alt=\"Monitor Workloads\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" />\n</li>\n<li><b>Command Line Support</b> &#8211; Sometimes, all we really want is a good command-line interface. We’re pleased to introduce CLPPlus support for dashDB.  CLPPlus is a command line user interface that can be used to connect to databases and define, edit, and run statements, scripts, and commands.  (No screenshot here, because as cool as command line is, it doesn’t make for an interesting visual!)</li>\n<li><b>UDX Support</b> &#8211; Sometimes applications or algorithms require something very special&#8230; something that we might not have provided out of the box.  dashDB now supports user-defined functions (UDFs) and user-defined aggregates (UDAs) to let you implement your own algorithms and have them run inside the database.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Security Features and Capabilities</h3>\n<p>You can’t embrace cloud without embracing security too, and dashDB is no stranger to the challenges of security in the cloud.  Here are some new security features in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>SSL Support for all Connections</b> &#8211; It’s not enough to automatically encrypt data at rest, we need to encrypt it in motion too.  dashDB now supports SSL for all connections to the database<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ibm-dashdb2.png\" alt=\"IBM dashDB\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" />\n</li>\n<li><b>Select Guardium Reports for all Plans</b> &#8211; dashDB now includes bundled Guardium reports for all plans including the Enterprise and Cloudant integrated plans.  This allows automatic discovery of sensitive data, as well as access reports and details of SQL statements that were run against that data.<br />\n<img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sensitive-data-report2.png\" alt=\"Sensitive Data Report\" style=\"border: 1px solid lightgray\" />\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In true cloud form, we’ll continue to add new features and capabilities to dashDB over the coming months, so keep on watching because great things are ahead!

And if you&#8217;re a developer deploying apps to IBM Bluemix, you&#8217;re a member of that community!</p>\n<h3>Bluemix and Cloud Foundry</h3>\n<p>Cloud Foundry is at the heart of IBM Bluemix. It&#8217;s the core technology responsible for deploying applications, scaling them, monitoring their health, routing their logs, and ensuring their availability. It defines a set of open APIs and contracts that enable applications on the cloud. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org\">Cloud Controller API</a> for deploying and managing applications\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/\">Buildpacks</a> that can support new application types and runtimes\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html\">Service brokers</a> to advertise services and manage their lifecycle\n</ul>\n<p>These contracts provide consistency across Foundry deployments and enable a full and vibrant ecosystem. Vendors that write to these interfaces can have faith that their code will just work while end users can expect similar concepts and implementations across deployments.</p>\n<p>Ensuring consistent functionality and behavior of core components across vendors is one of the key responsibilities of the foundation. The foundation&#8217;s trademark programs and certification processes call out a set of required software components that must be part of any certified PaaS offering, without modification or substitution, while still allowing vendors to differentiate their offerings. Our IBM Bluemix web console, Liberty buildpack, and extended service catalog of IBM middleware, Watson technologies, and third party services are examples of unique capabilities we are bringing into our own Cloud Foundry deployment.</p>\n<h3>Getting Involved</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in what&#8217;s happening in the Cloud Foundry community, I invite you to have a look. The guiding principles of the foundation ensure that you will always have access to what&#8217;s going on. In addition to making the source code available on <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry\">GitHub</a>, the structure of the various projects, the project roadmaps, development stories, and status will continue to be publicly <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki\">available</a> and anyone can raise issues or comment on features.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a user of Cloud Foundry, we want you to voice your opinions. Let us know what&#8217;s on your mind by joining our development <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/cloudfoundry.org/forum/#!forum/vcap-dev\">forum</a>. If you&#8217;re a strong advocate, you may even be asked to join the foundation&#8217;s User Advisory Board and help represent the needs and concerns of the end user community.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2014/12/cloud-foundry-foundation-launch/","date":"2014-12-08T13:00:09","modified":"2016-12-07T16:35:54","format":"standard","slug":"cloud-foundry-foundation-launch","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=7453","excerpt":"<p>Last year, IBM and Pivotal announced an agreement to develop an open governance model for Cloud Foundry.

As a developer you can now leverage the power of Docker to deploy a container on Bluemix. The IBM Containers service is super easy to use. No need to deploy and manage Virtual Machines, set up Docker engine, or manage your own registries.

Right now for the beta you will be allowed to 2GB of memory, 2 Public IP addresses to attach to your containers, and 8 containers total. These limits will change in the future. Create the instance as normal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/containers-blog-2-1024x397.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Demand for the service is high right now, so once you create the service you may be placed in the queue and receive a notification like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/containers-blog-3-1024x528.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Once your service instance is activated you will see the getting started screen. You will be asked to provide a name for your private Docker image registry. You will also see your API key that you will need to access the service from your command line. Make sure you have docker and the IBM Containers (ice) tools installed on your machine using the instructions provided.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/containers-blog-4-1024x440.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Run a Container</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started and run a container. The IBM Containers service comes with images for WebSphere Liberty and Node.js. And of course you can use any image from Docker Hub. Let&#8217;s use the Liberty image to start a basic application service container. That is easy to do. Simply do the following:</p>\n<p><code>&gt; ice run --name liberty registry-ice.ng.bluemix.net/ibmliberty</code></p>\n<p>This will launch your container on bluemix and give it a private IP address. Run &#8220;&gt; ice ps&#8221; to see the running instance. You should get something like this:</p>\n<p><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0b33eecf53736bbc83c7.js\"></script></p>\n<p>In order to send a request to this container you need to give it a public IP. This is easy as well. First request a public IP address.</p>\n<p><code>$ ice ip request<br />\n Successfully obtained ip: \"129.41.248.43\"</code></p>\n<p>Now attach that IP address to your running container</p>\n<p><code>$ ice ip bind 129.41.248.43 liberty<br />\n Successfully bound ip </code></p>\n<p>If you run &#8220;ice ps&#8221; again you will see that the container is now accessible on the new IP address.</p>\n<p><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/anonymous/26de9ee5ca0db570c580.js\"></script></p>\n<p>You can then go to that IP address to access your container.</p>\n<h2>Use a custom image</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s do one last thing. Let&#8217;s add an application to that WebSphere Liberty Image and run the new image. To do this we are going to build a new image using Dockerfile. To start lets pull the Liberty image to your local machine.</p>\n<p><code>$ docker pull registry-ice.ng.bluemix.net/ibmliberty</code></p>\n<p>Next lets create a Dockerfile with your app in it. For this example I am using a simple hello WAR file. Your Dockerfile would look something like this.</p>\n<p><code>&gt;&gt;<br />\nFROM registry-ice.ng.bluemix.net/ibmliberty<br />\nADD hello.war /opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/dropins/<br />\nENV LICENSE accept</code></p>\n<p>Now you can build the image</p>\n<p><code>$ docker build -t hello .</code></p>\n<p>Now that we have our new image lets push it to your private registry on the IBM Containers service and run it. To push it do the following:</p>\n<p><code>$ docker tag hello registry-ice.ng.bluemix.net//hello (replace with the private registry namespace you selected at the beginning)<br />\n$ docker push registry-ice.ng.bluemix.net//hello</code></p>\n<p>Now all you have to do is run it like above and bind the IP address.</p>\n<p><code>$ ice run --name hello registry-ice.ng.bluemix.net//hello<br />\n$ ice ip bind</code></p>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>address&gt; hello</p>\n<h2>The Service UI</h2>\n<p>In addition to the command line interface you can view the containers you are running and the images in your registry via the Bluemix UI. Simply go to the IBM Containers service tile in your Dashboard. Select the containers tab to see your running containers&#8230;</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/containers-blog-5-1024x461.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>&#8230;and the Images tab to see your images.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/containers-blog-6-1024x382.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Check back often for more information about this exciting new capability as it rapidly evolves over the coming weeks.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2014/12/ibm-containers-beta-docker/","date":"2014-12-04T14:06:56","modified":"2016-12-07T16:26:28","format":"standard","slug":"ibm-containers-beta-docker","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=7411","excerpt":"<p>At DockerCon Europe today we announced the availability of the beta of our new IBM container service on Bluemix. </p>\n<table bgcolor=\"#135c6f\" style=\"width:100%\">\n<tr>\n<th><center><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store&#038;serviceOfferingGuid=3a79bdf2-a8d3-4b72-b70d-db1650124c73&#038;fromCatalog=true\" style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Get Started with IBM Containers</center></th>\n</tr>\n</table>\n","menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America/New_York","date_gmt":"2014-12-04T19:06:56","modified_tz":"America/New_York","modified_gmt":"2016-12-07T21:26:28","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/7411","author":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/339","collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts","replies":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/7411/comments","version-history":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/posts/7411/revisions"}},"featured_image":null,"terms":{"post_tag":[{"ID":639,"name":"announcements","slug":"announcements","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":159,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/announcements/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/639"}}},{"ID":621,"name":"beta","slug":"beta","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":14,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/beta/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/621"}}},{"ID":561,"name":"Bluemix","slug":"bluemix","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":508,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/bluemix/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/561"}}},{"ID":595,"name":"video","slug":"video","description":"","taxonomy":"post_tag","parent":null,"count":96,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/tag/video/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/post_tag/terms/595"}}}],"category":[{"ID":1963,"name":"What's New","slug":"whats-new","description":"<p class=\"ibm-ind-link\"><a class=\"ibm-btn-pri ibm-forward-link ibm-btn-orange-50\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?cm_sp=Blog-_-categories-_-general\">Get started with Bluemix today</a></p>","taxonomy":"category","parent":null,"count":273,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/category/whats-new/","meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms","self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/taxonomies/category/terms/1963"}}}]}},{"ID":6967,"title":"Bluemix London Now Live!","status":"publish","type":"post","author":{"ID":17,"username":"aerwin@us.ibm.com","name":"Anthony Erwin","first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Erwin","nickname":"aerwin@us.ibm.com","slug":"aerwinus-ibm-com","URL":"","avatar":"","description":"","registered":"2016-09-22T14:33:51+00:00","meta":{"links":{"self":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/17","archives":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-json/users/17/posts"}}},"content":"<p style=\"display: none;

So, there is now a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net/\">UK-hosted Bluemix UI</a> and a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bluemix.net\">U.S.-hosted Bluemix UI</a>.</p>\n<p>You might choose one region or the other for a variety of reasons. For example, to decrease application latency, you might select the region closest to the majority of your users. As another example, you may prefer to have your data stored in a particular region to address security concerns. Finally, you might deploy an app to both regions so if one region has failures, the apps in the other region will continue to run.</p>\n<p><em>For more conceptual info about regions, see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#overview/overview.html#ov_intro__reg\"><em>Regions</em></a> topic in the Bluemix docs.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px; font-weight: inherit;\">UI Updates</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 2px;\">With multiple regions enabled, you&#8217;ll notice a few changes in the Bluemix UI:</p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left:20px;\">\n<li><i>Region selector</i> &mdash; The banner in the Bluemix UI now shows you which region you&#8217;re working in and provides a pulldown menu that allows you to choose a different region. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bluemixRegionsPulldown_annotated.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bluemixRegionsPulldown_annotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: IBM and Twitter\" style=\"display: block; margin: 20px auto 20px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 90%; height: auto; max-width: 2166px; max-height: 620px;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Region Selector\" scale=\"0\"></a></li>\n<li><em>Usage by region</em> &mdash; Usage for both regions is combined into a single view for billing.

That pace of delivery and the instant feedback associated with cloud-based services is changing what we build and how we build it.</p>\n<p>When we talk to our enterprise clients they want to drive the same type of transformation as IBM.  They want to move fast and innovate, but create the right types of environments where their developers can do that in a controlled way.  This is why cloud platforms are so attractive to enterprise as a model, especially for hybrid cloud, because it creates a defined, scalable environment where services and APIs can be deployed and consumed and where new applications can be built and run using those same sets of approved capabilities, whether they are internally produced or vendor provided.</p>\n<p>We are making a<a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/45462.wss\"> series of announcements today</a> that will help our clients to move into this model of development and delivery.</p>\n<h2>The Bluemix Expansion</h2>\n<p><b>Bluemix Dedicated </b>&#8211; <a href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/solutions/solution=bluemix_dedicated\">Bluemix Dedicated</a> is your own, single-tenant Bluemix environment, hosted in an isolated SoftLayer instance and managed by us.  It is a deployment model that addresses many questions associated with corporate policy, data residency (Bluemix Dedicated is available in any <a href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/42956.wss\">IBM Cloud Center</a>), privacy, noisy neighbors, enterprise connectivity and more.</p>\n<p>The services that we are bringing into Bluemix Dedicated are the ones that are focused on data.  We&#8217;ll have services like Cloudant and data caching available immediately and will rapidly deliver more over the course of the ensuing months.  But a key component of the value of Bluemix Dedicated is the connection it shares to the public cloud instance of Bluemix.  Developers can pull in APIs and services from our public cloud and use those capabilities in applications that might be running in Bluemix Dedicated.</p>\n<p>To the point about running applications, our full set of runtimes, including the ability to bring your own buildpacks, will be available immediately.</p>\n<p>With Bluemix Dedicated we are also taking advantage of some of the unique advantages of SoftLayer, namely isolation, high-performance networking and enterprise connectivity that feels like a natural extension to your data center.</p>\n<p>And perhaps most interesting opportunity about Bluemix Dedicated is what you will bring.  This is an environment where you can build and expose your own services.</p>\n<p><!--<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3Xp9hYIUNr8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>--><br />\n<div data-widget=\"videoplayer\" data-videoid=\"3Xp9hYIUNr8\" data-videotype=\"youtube\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xp9hYIUNr8\">Watch the video</a></div></p>\n<table bgcolor=\"#135c6f\" style=\"width:100%\">\n<tr>\n<th><center><a href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/solutions/solution=bluemix_dedicated\" style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Learn more about Bluemix Dedicated</center></th>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><b>Private API Catalog</b> &#8211; What we are really working toward with our enterprise clients is letting them take a policy driven approach to the way they deal with data and placement of workloads.

We are introducing new capabilities like in-database analytic functions, which allow you to run analytics wherever that data resides within your warehouse. These analytic functions help accelerate your application performance when executing analytical queries. For example, you can now use geospatial libraries to load and access location data within IBM dashDB for analysis and visualization purposes. Additionally, we have updated the R language capabilities with RODBC and bluR packages to simplify access and sharing of R objects.</p>\n<p>These changes will not require any changes for you at the application level.

We’ll auto-create one for you. You’ll be granted with 10GBs of storage space, enough to host and serve up to 2 hours of HD video (more is available via upgrade). It also comes with the benefits of adding your own branding, and access to our APIs.</p>\n<p><b>Installing Ustream for IBM Cloud service</b></p>\n<p>Adding and binding instances of our service to your Bluemix apps is easy. You can do it directly from the Cloud Foundry command line interface, or if you prefer you can use the Bluemix catalog in your browser. There is a detailed walkthrough about the installation <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/ustream/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">in the Docs section of Bluemix</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Getting started with Ustream</b></p>\n<p>When you use Ustream, you broadcast live and store videos under a dedicated channel page. Every channel has a unique id in Ustream’s system. In Bluemix when you add Ustream for IBM Cloud, we automatically create a channel that belongs under your Ustream account. Beyond that, you can embed your video on any site or social network that makes sense for your brand.</p>\n<p>When you bind our service to an app, your channel id will appear in the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable.</p>\n<p><code><br />\n\"credentials\": {<br />\n       \"accessToken\": \"7da97cef47bfd50448c87bcddc2845092dd23\",<br />\n       \"channelID\": \"18917840\",<br />\n       \"clientID\": \"0b1d4394f50eb4b786df8eed70e5d6fbe051df95\",<br />\n       \"clientSecret\": \"0b1d4394f50eb4b786dfeed70e5d6fbe051df95\"<br />\n   },<br />\n   \"label\": \"ustream\",<br />\n   \"name\": \"my-service-name\",<br />\n   \"plan\": \"basic\"<br />\n}<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>You can also find it on <a href=\"https://ibmcloud.ustream.tv/\">ibmcloud.ustream.tv</a>, a customized dashboard page you can click through from the Bluemix service dashboard.</p>\n<p><b>Ustream API basics</b></p>\n<p>For uploading and managing videos, and changing various channel settings we provide you an HTTP-based (RESTful) API that uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization.</p>\n<p>Your API client ID and client secret is generated when you add the Ustream service to your application. You can grab them from the dashboard, or from your VCAP_SERVICES environment variable.</p>\n<p><b>Implementing OAuth 2.0, or starting right away with a token</b></p>\n<p>To save you some time, we also generate an access token for you. With this you can try the API without implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication in your app. If it expires, you can get a new one on the dashboard, or implement OAuth 2.0 authentication in your app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ibmcloud.ustream.tv/dashboard/api#Authenticating\" target=\"_blank\">More on the possible authentication methods.</a></p>\n<p><b>Uploading and managing videos</b></p>\n<p>Once you’ve got your channel id and  API access, it’s time to start uploading videos. You can do this with our API, our directly from the browser.</p>\n<p>Using the API you initiate an FTP uploading process by calling our uploads endpoint. <a href=\"https://ibmcloud.ustream.tv/dashboard/api#APIFeaturesUploadVideos\" target=\"_blank\">More on this in the API docs.</a></p>\n<p>Same applies to getting a list of your uploaded content, changing the appearance of the player, or hiding your channel from our main website, Ustream.tv.</p>\n<p><b>Embed API</b></p>\n<p>Once you are done, and ready to take your content public (or share it internally within your company, it’s up to you), you can start playing around with the Ustream player. Grabbing the embed code, and playing your videos on your website or mobile application.</p>\n<p>But that just skims the surface, with our Embed API you can have superior control over the Ustream player. Here’s a few things you can do: (un)load specific content, seek, set the volume level, see how many viewed, and even control certain parts of your web page, according to what is happening on the video (or vice versa). Only limit is your imagination and creativity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ibmcloud.ustream.tv/dashboard/api#APIFeaturesControlThePlayer\" target=\"_blank\">More on Ustream Embed API here.</a></p>\n<p>These now all a few simple steps away in Bluemix.

When combined with the IBM Bluemix platform, <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/IoT/index.html\">IBM Internet of Things Foundation</a> provides simple, but powerful, and scalable application access to devices and their data. You can rapidly build applications, visualization dashboards, mobile apps, and applications that can feed your back-end enterprise with IoT data.</p>\n<p>The IBM Internet of Things Foundation service is now part of Bluemix and replaces the Beta that has been running since July.</p>\n<p>IoT Foundation enables developers to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connect:</strong> Securely connect things to your applications</li>\n<li><strong>Collect:</strong> Collect and manage a time-series view of data from things</li>\n<li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Visually assemble flows to process your data with <a href=\"http://nodered.org/\">Node-Red</a> and Bluemix</li>\n<li><strong>Manage:</strong> Manage connections and subscriptions with a highly scalable service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have been working in partnership with a number of device manufacturers including <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/45102.wss\">ARM, B&amp;B Electronics, Elecsys, Intel, Multi-Tech Systems, Inc. and Texas Instruments</a> to deliver additional functionality and integration.</p>\n<h2>The Core Capabilities of IoT Foundation</h2>\n<p><strong>Register and Connect to a wide variety of devices</strong>. In minutes you can have something running with our <a title=\"IBM IoT Foundation Quickstart\" href=\"https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/\">Quickstart</a> which visualizes live data from your device. Next, you can register your device with the IoT Foundation to protect its data, ensuring that it is only visible to the applications you compose with it. You can also see which devices are connected and the last messages they sent. Development boards and devices from a number of our partners are connected to the service using <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/iot/\">recipes</a>. Extend these recipes to get the data you need for your next Internet of Things application.</p>\n<p><strong>Collect data from your devices.  </strong>IoT data visualization lets you see what is happening on your devices in near-real time. The service stores your device events in a time-series database historian.  You can build dashboards and gain access to historical data through <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/iot/recipes/api-documentation/\">HTTP based APIs</a> and then  get that data currently trapped on instrumented devices back to your business.</p>\n<p><strong>Assemble IoT events</strong> with your applications and other services running in Bluemix. The <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/IoT/index.html#iot500\">IoT Starter Application</a> uses the simple drag-and-drop interface of Node-RED to let you easily assemble applications built from the IoT Foundation and other Bluemix services.  You can use these capabilities to optimize decision making based on the real data streaming off your sensors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pricing Model</h2>\n<p>The service measures and charges for the following usage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The number of devices connected</li>\n<li>The amount of data the devices exchange with the system and applications</li>\n<li>The amount of data stored in the historian</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the first instance we are providing a free plan for Bluemix with limits on the amount of data exchanged, data stored and the number of devices. These limits are set so that you can get started and begin building your IoT applications with no service cost. We will soon be adding additional plans to this free option so that you can scale up your use as your number of devices and amount of data flowing grows.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/IoT/index.html\">starter instructions</a> lead you through creating your Internet of Things starter application from the boilerplates section of the catalog.</p>\n<p>You can set up a web based simulator which will act as your device for the few next steps. From here a visualization web page hosted in our Quickstart service shows live data flowing from your device. If you aren&#8217;t convinced that these things are sending data via our service, then run the two on separate machines or mobile devices. To do this all you need to do is enter the device identifier from one to the other. With the simulator sending data all is set to now feed the Node-RED flow in your starter application and the instructions walk you through this change.</p>\n<p>The rest of the getting started document takes you through adding the IoT Foundation service, registering a device and having this feed your Node-RED flow. To learn more visit our <a title=\"Getting Sarted\" href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/IoT/index.html#gettingstartedtemplate\">main service documentation</a> to see what else is possible. Because IoT Foundation is accessible through Bluemix you can integrate with other services to build more robust, feature-rich and scalable applications.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited to see what you&#8217;ll build and, as always reach out to us in either the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/answers/?community=bluemix\">Bluemix Developer forums </a> or our <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/answers/?community=iot\">IoT forums</a> if you have questions.</p>\n<p><!--<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bR2Iztum4b8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>--><br />\n<div data-widget=\"videoplayer\" data-videoid=\"bR2Iztum4b8\" data-videotype=\"youtube\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR2Iztum4b8\">Watch the video</a></div></p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2014/10/internet-of-things-foundation/","date":"2014-10-22T10:43:46","modified":"2016-12-07T16:36:03","format":"standard","slug":"internet-of-things-foundation","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=6215","excerpt":"<p>A new service just went live which addresses the key challenge of bringing the world of sensors and controllers with that of big data and analytics.

This allows other developers in your organization to create and bind your service to their apps and use your APIs. In the screenshot below, I&#8217;ve created a new private service called <span style=\"font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 10px; display: inline-block;\"><code>Tony_API</code></span>.

I usually don&#8217;t go into much detail on these smaller tweaks in my blog posts, but this time around I thought I&#8217;d highlight one in particular.</p>\n<p>The App Details page has a <b>View Guide</b> button that provides getting started information for the app. The information includes instructions on how to download the starter code and use the command line to push code updates. However, during usability testing, we found that there was a problem. When the user would try to switch to the command line app, the guide would disappear. Of course, it&#8217;s really frustrating to not be able to see the very commands you wanted to type in!</p>\n<p>So, based on this user feedback, we&#8217;ve made an adjustment so the guide will remain open when switching to another app. This is a small thing, but makes a big difference for someone trying to get started with Bluemix. And, it&#8217;s an example of how we take this kind of feedback seriously.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px;\"><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/notificatonsPanelStaysOpen.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 20px auto 20px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 70%; height: auto; max-width: 2022px; max-height: 1400px; border: 1px solid #26343F;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Getting Started Update\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/notificatonsPanelStaysOpen.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Getting Started Update\" /></a></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 1em 0px 0px 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid;\">Related Announcements</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">There&#8217;s a lot of exciting stuff going on outside of the Bluemix UI as well, and there&#8217;s just too much to cover in one blog post.

To access it, simply provision an instance of the new MQ Light service, and click on it from your dashboard in the Bluemix web interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/mq-light/ui-tooling-design/\">Using this interface</a>, you will be able to see the activities of applications using this service instance: senders appear on the left hand side, receivers on the right-hand side, and any messages flowing will be in the middle. You can click on ‘Topic List’ for senders and on ‘Details’ for receivers to get more information about the connected applications. Click on ‘Details’ in any of the messages to get some more information on it, such as the payload, who sent it, to where, and whether or not anyone is waiting for it. This is perfect for troubleshooting messaging applications as you can see what your messages are actually doing.</p>\n<p><b>An enhanced node.js API</b><br /> In line with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/2014/09/23/formal-announcement/\">announcement of IBM MQ Light V1.0</a>, we have updated our node.js API, which brings improved stability, bug fixes, but also all of the enhancements in <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/2014/09/22/mq-light-beta-3/\">MQ Light Beta 3</a>.</p>\n<p><b>An improved back-end infrastructure</b><br />We&#8217;ve been busy making important changes behind the scenes as well.

The new features include enhancements to collaboration, catalog, solutions pages, and responsiveness. You&#8217;ll also notice updates to Bluemix Documentation with improved search, filtering, and mobile rendering. And, finally, there was a healthy dose of general bug squashing and usability tweaks. Keep reading for all the details.</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Improved Collaboration w/ Orgs and Spaces</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">One less publicized feature of the Bluemix UI (until now!) is the ability to manage <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#acctmgmt/index.html#organdspaces\" title=\"organizations and spaces\" target=\"_blank\">organizations and spaces</a>. Organizations are made up of <em>spaces</em>, and spaces act as a collection of related apps, services, and users. The combination of orgs and spaces allow collaboration between people working on common apps and services.</p>\n<p>As part of the July release, we&#8217;ve made a bunch of improvements for orgs and spaces. But, most notably we&#8217;ve:</p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 20px;\">\n<li>Added the capability to invite other users to participate in your orgs and spaces.</li>\n<li>Enabled the ability to create new organizations (for subscription and pay-as-you-go users).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0; font-weight: inherit;\">Getting Started With Org Management</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 2px;\">The easiest way to start working with orgs and spaces in the Bluemix UI is to click the Org Selector in the banner at the top of the page. The Org Selector shows the list of orgs that you are a member of. By default, you are in one org (and that org&#8217;s name is equal your user id). At the bottom of the Org Selector, you can click the <strong>Manage Organizations</strong> option to launch the org management panel.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bannerManageOrganizationsAnnotated.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bannerManageOrganizationsAnnotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Manage Organizations from Banner\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 75%; height: auto; max-width: 756px; max-height: 178px;\" /></a></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0; font-weight: inherit;\">Invite Your Friends &amp; Co-workers</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 2px;\">When you select an organization in the Manage Organizations section of the Bluemix UI, the first thing you&#8217;ll see is the list of users in that org. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see my personal organization. You&#8217;ll note I&#8217;m the only member, and I&#8217;m also the &#8220;account owner&#8221; (which means if there are charges they&#8217;d come to me).</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orgs_1_JustMeAnnotated.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orgs_1_JustMeAnnotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Invite New Users Link\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 50%; height: auto; max-width: 707px; max-height: 622px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no fun to work alone, so now you can invite your friends and co-workers to collaborate. If you click the <b>Invite New Users</b> link (shown in screenshot above), then you will be presented with a dialog like the one below. In the top portion, enter the name and e-mail address of the person you want to invite. In the bottom section, you can set what roles the user will have initially (both in the org and within the org&#8217;s spaces). In this case, I want <em>somebody@example.com</em> to be a developer in my <em>demo</em> space, but not have any other access. When I hit the <strong>Invite</strong> button, an e-mail will be sent to the person I invited, and he (or she) will now be part of my org. In this case, as a developer in my <em>demo</em> space, <em>somebody@example.com</em> will be able to do anything with the apps and services (create, start, stop, bind, etc.) that I can.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orgs_2_InvitingColleague.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orgs_2_InvitingColleague.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Invite New User Dialog\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 50%; height: auto; max-width: 641px; max-height: 698px;\" /></a></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0; font-weight: inherit;\">Create New Organizations</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 2px;\">The other big improvement to org and space management, is the ability to create new orgs. Previously, you could create new spaces within an organization. But, starting with today&#8217;s updates, subscription and pay-as-you-go users can also create brand new organizations. This means you can construct orgs dedicated to specific purposes and have entirely different sets of users in each.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/createOrgAnnotated.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/createOrgAnnotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Custom Domain Selection\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 75%; height: auto; max-width: 1166px; max-height: 417px;\" /></a></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Catalog Improvements</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">We&#8217;ve also made several usability updates to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/store\">Bluemix Catalog</a>. The Catalog is the place to go to browse and create instances of Bluemix starter apps and service offerings. We&#8217;ve made a number of improvements in this area, but two of the the most noticeable are the ability to specify a custom domain when creating apps and the addition of a more powerful country selector.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0; font-weight: inherit;\">Select Custom Domain on App Creation</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 2px;\">Previously, we provided the ability to create <a target=\"bluemixGA_DW\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2014/06/23/using-custom-domain-names-bluemix\">custom domains</a> for your apps instead of the default <strong>mybluemix.net</strong> domain. With today&#8217;s update, we&#8217;ve made it easier to use those custom domains at app creation time. After you&#8217;ve named your app and given it a hostname, you can then choose from a list of custom domains.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/customDomainAnnotated.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/customDomainAnnotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Create Organization\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 75%; height: auto; max-width: 967px; max-height: 445px;\" /></a></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0; font-weight: inherit;\">Typeahead Country Selector</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 2px;\">We&#8217;ve also made it easier to view the prices for different countries when exploring a particular starter app or service offering. If you click the link for the currently selected country, a typeahead country selector will be presented. Simply start typing the name of the country of interest, and you will be presented with possible matches. Once you find the country you&#8217;re interested in, select it to view an updated set of prices.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/countrySelector2_Annotated.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/countrySelector2_Annotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Catalog Country Selector\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 75%; height: auto; max-width: 1161px; max-height: 308px;\" /></a></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Dynamic Solutions Pages</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">At GA, we introduced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/solutions/solution=WebAndApp\">Solutions Pages</a> to inform you about available services that can help you compose solutions to problems in categories such as Web and Application, Big Data, Mobile, Internet of Things, etc. As of today, these pages are dynamic so that as new services come on board, they will automatically appear. In addition, you can click on any of the services listed on the Solutions Pages to find out more details and/or create new instances.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/solutions.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/solutions-1024x769.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Dynamic Solutions Pages\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 75%; height: auto; max-width: 980px; max-height: 735px;\" /></a></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Improved Responsiveness</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">We&#8217;ve heard feedback from many of you that you want a better Bluemix experience on mobile devices. We&#8217;re not yet where we want to be, but we did make a number of changes to improve the responsiveness of the Bluemix UI. The most noticeable improvements are in the banner at the top of the page, action bars for Dashboard and App Details, details pages for specific catalog items, and the top portion of the pricing sheet. Look for more improvements over time.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/responsiveHome.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/responsiveHome.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Banner Responsiveness\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 25%; height: auto; max-width: 405px; max-height: 809px;\" /></a></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Documentation</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">We want to make it as easy as possible for you to find what you need. With that in mind, our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#\">Bluemix Documentation</a> site now has improved search functionality that includes typeahead and filtering features by service and runtime. You can selectively find content in topic titles, code snippets, and in full text.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/11B20759.gif\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/11B20759.gif\" alt=\"Bluemix Documentation Typeahead Search\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 332px; height: auto; max-width: 332px; max-height: 387px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>We also made some improvements for docs on the go, so that you can more easily view the Bluemix docs on your mobile device.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/docsOnMobile.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/docsOnMobile.png\" alt=\"Bluemix Documentation on Mobile\" style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 25%; height: auto; max-width: 802px; max-height: 1614px;\" /></a></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Misc Defects and Usability Updates</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">\nA major focus area for July was reduction of our defect backlog. We fixed dozens of defects that, along with some functional glitches, included styling updates and usability improvements. There are too many to list here, but we hope you notice a cleaner and more pleasant experience overall.\n</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">What&#8217;s Next?</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">We&#8217;re continually trying to improve the Bluemix experience, and we&#8217;d love to hear from you.

If you go to the Cost Estimator, you&#8217;ll see a list of all available runtimes and services. You can quickly enter your estimates in the text fields to get a projection of how much your configuration will cost for the month.</p>\n<p>For example, in the screen shot below I made the assumption that I&#8217;d have 1 instance of a Node.js app with a memory allocation of 1 GB. Under the covers, the Cost Estimator calculated projected GB-hours and estimated a price (taking the free allowances from the previous section into account). If you scroll down the page, you can also enter estimates for service usage (like number of notifications used by the <a href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store&amp;serviceOfferingGuid=987798a2-5799-465b-a06f-0609dc9ce9f7\" target=\"_blank\">Push</a> service or number of build minutes used by the <a href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store&amp;serviceOfferingGuid=6a6d6a28-3c6e-4950-974c-1be974cdd113\" target=\"_blank\">Delivery Pipeline</a> add-on).</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pricingSheetGlobal.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 972px; max-width: 1304px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 50%; border: 1px solid lightGray;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Cost Estimator\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pricingSheetGlobal.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Cost Estimator\" /></a></p>\n<p>In addition, the redesigned <a href=\"#AppDetails\">App Details</a> makes it easy to generate an estimate for a particular app. From App Details, you can click on the new <b>Estimate the cost of this app</b> link. The Cost Estimator will be launched, pre-populated with the app&#8217;s runtime and bound services. For example, in the screen shot below, I&#8217;ve clicked on the link for one of my Java apps that uses the <a href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store&amp;serviceOfferingGuid=14c83ad2-6fd4-439a-8c3a-d1a20f8a2381\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudant NoSQL DB</a> service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pricingSheetApp.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 879px; max-width: 1314px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 50%; border: 1px solid lightGray;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Cost Estimator for App\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pricingSheetApp.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Cost Estimator for App\" /></a></p>\n<p>Finally, many of you have told us you want to be able to use the Bluemix UI on mobile devices. So, with that in mind, we set out to build the Cost Estimator with mobile responsiveness right from the start. In the screen shot below, you can see an example of the Cost Estimator running on an iPhone. So, now, you can estimate costs from anywhere!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/costEstimator_iPhone.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 810px; max-width: 401px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 25%;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Cost Estimator on iPhone\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/costEstimator_iPhone.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Cost Estimator on iPhone\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"AppDetails\" style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid;\">Redesigned App Details</h2>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Overview</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">The App Details page is the place to go if you want to see all of the information about one of your apps. Because it&#8217;s such an important part of the UI, we interviewed many users to find out how we could make it better. We took your feedback seriously and completely redesigned App Details to make app data more accessible, improve the overall aesthetics, add new function (like a link to the Cost Estimator), and enable responsiveness for tablets and hand-held devices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appDetailsFull.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 961px; max-width: 1081px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 75%;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appDetailsFull.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details\" /></a></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Runtime Card</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">We made it easier for you to adjust the number of instances and memory per instance for your app by moving these controls to the Runtime Card near the top of App Details. If you want to scale your app up or down, just adjust the spinners. As you do that, the <b>Available Memory</b> field is updated to show the amount of memory that would be left in your organization&#8217;s quota. When you&#8217;re ready, hit <b>Save</b> to commit the changes and your app will be rescaled automatically.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/runtimeCard.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 302px; max-width: 1384px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 75%;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details Runtime Card\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/runtimeCard.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details Runtime Card\" /></a></p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<h3 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Activity Log</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">One of the top five user requirements from our research was the ability to see historical activity for apps. And, that&#8217;s exactly what you see in the new Activity Log. The entries in the log indicate when the app was started or stopped, experienced a crash, or was modified. The log is sorted so the most recent events appear at the top.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appDetailsActivityLogFull.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 308px; max-width: 309px; position: relative; text-align: center;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details Activity Log\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appDetailsActivityLogFull.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details Activity Log\" /></a><br />\nThe output consists of the type of data you would see if you ran <code>cf events</code> from the command line, but far easier to understand:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&lt;code&gt;\r\n$ cf events mobile-demo\r\nGetting events for app mobile-demo in org aerwin@us.ibm.com / space august as aerwin@us.ibm.com...\r\n\r\ntime                          event              actor               description   \r\n2014-08-29T04:07:23.00-0400   audit.app.update   aerwin@us.ibm.com   state: STARTED   \r\n2014-08-29T04:07:15.00-0400   audit.app.update   aerwin@us.ibm.com   state: STOPPED   \r\n2014-08-29T04:06:44.00-0400   audit.app.update   aerwin@us.ibm.com   state: STARTED   \r\n2014-08-29T04:06:40.00-0400   audit.app.update   aerwin@us.ibm.com   instances: 1, memory: 128   \r\n...  \r\n&lt;/code&gt;</pre>\n<p>And, even cooler, as app events occur the display is updated in real-time! So, if another developer in your organization stops your main storefront app, you&#8217;d see that immediately in the Activity Log. And, then, you could go have a few words with him. <img src=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n</div>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px;\">Cost Estimator for Specific App</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">As mentioned <a href=\"#CostEstimator\">earlier</a>, a new section in App Details provides a link to the Cost Estimator.

For example, the screen shot below shows App Details on an iPad:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appDetails_iPad.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 1124px; max-width: 867px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 50%;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details on iPad\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appDetails_iPad.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details on iPad\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, the screen shot below shows an iPhone rendering of the same information:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appDetails_iPhone.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 806px; max-width: 392px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 25%;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details on iPhone\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appDetails_iPhone.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: App Details on iPhone\" /></a></p>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"SSLCerts\" style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid;\">Secure Your Custom Domains With SSL Certificates</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">The ability to <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/index-gentopic3.html#genTopProcId4\" target=\"_blank\">create custom domains</a> for use in your apps has been around for awhile. But, now with the August release, you can also <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/index-gentopic4.html\" target=\"_blank\">secure them with SSL certificates</a>!</p>\n<p>At the time of this writing, associating an SSL certificate with your custom domain is free. However, the function is limited to pay-as-you-go and subscription customers. In addition, only one SSL certificate upload per organization is permitted. To get started, look for the new <b>Upload Certificate</b> button on the <i>Manage Domains</i> tab.</p>\n<p><b>UPDATE:</b> I&#8217;ve written a detailed guide to using this functionality in a separate blog post called <a href=\"http://www.tonyerwin.com/2014/09/bluemix-ui-ssl-certificates-and-custom.html\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Bluemix UI: SSL Certificates and Custom Domains</i></a>.<br />\n<a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/customDomainWithSSLUpload_Annotated.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 20px auto 10px auto; max-height: 643px; max-width: 705px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 75%;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Custom Domains with SSL Certificate Upload\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/customDomainWithSSLUpload_Annotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Custom Domains with SSL Certificate Upload\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"BluemixForIOS\" style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid;\">Apple iOS Solutions Page</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/ios\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; text-align: center; position: relative; width: 75%; height: auto; max-width: 2388px; max-height: 252px;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Bluemix &amp; iOS\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BluemixAndiOSShort1.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Bluemix &amp; iOS\" /></a></p>\n<p>On July 15, IBM and Apple <a href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/44370.wss\" target=\"_blank\">announced a partnership</a> to work together to transform the use of mobile in the enterprise. This month, the Bluemix UI was updated with a new <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/ios\" target=\"_blank\">iOS Solutions Page</a> that describes the power of the Bluemix and iOS combination. As the new page states, &#8220;IBM Bluemix for iOS is an enterprise-grade cloud platform to build and deploy elegant, integrated apps for iOS.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">Bluemix is about helping you quickly compose building blocks to solve your problems. With the addition of the iOS Solutions Page, there are now a total of 11 solutions pages in the Bluemix UI. Each is intended to help you see how Bluemix services can be used together to form solutions in these major areas:</p>\n<table style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid #3b4b54;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px;\">\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/web-applications\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Web and Application</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/devops\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">DevOps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/security\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Security</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/iot\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Internet of Things</a></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/ios\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">iOS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/capstone\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Integration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/bigdata\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Big Data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/open-architecture\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Open Cloud</a></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px;\">\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/mobile\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Mobile</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/data-management\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Data Management</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/business-analytics\" target=\"bluemixGA_Solutions\">Business Analytics</a></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"CatalogMedia\" style=\"margin: 1em 0px 0px 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid;\">Catalog Images/Videos</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">We&#8217;ve also worked to make improvements to the <a href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store\" target=\"_blank\">Catalog</a>. For example, you&#8217;ll begin to notice more and more offerings providing additional media (such as images and videos) to help you make an informed decision. For example, the screen shot below shows the new scrollable multimedia section of the <a href=\"https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store&amp;serviceOfferingGuid=92c8b899-8163-4cbc-a934-0f930cd69918\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics Warehouse</a> service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/analyticsWarehouseMedia_annotated.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 711px; max-width: 1266px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 50%;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Catalog Details Multimedia List (Analytics Warehouse)\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/analyticsWarehouseMedia_annotated.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Catalog Details Multimedia List (Analytics Warehouse)\" /></a></p>\n<p>Clicking on one of the items in the list expands it in a lightbox as shown below.

And, we&#8217;ve also made a number of less obvious usability improvements. For example, we&#8217;ve taken steps to enable responsiveness for the list view in the main Dashboard:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dashboardListView2_iPad.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 1116px; max-width: 865px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 25%;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Dashboard in iPad with List View (Scrolled)\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dashboardListView2_iPad.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Dashboard in iPad with List View (Scrolled)\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"DocumentationUpdates\" style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid;\">Documentation Updates</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">We want to make it as easy as possible for you to find the information you need to build your apps and leverage services. With that in mind, we added a new feature so you can quickly select a specific programming language or mobile operating system while browsing a service&#8217;s documentation. Currently, only some services support this feature, but more will over time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/context_switching.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 10px auto 10px auto; max-height: 1116px; max-width: 333px; position: relative; text-align: center; border: 1px solid lightGray;\" title=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Documentation Context Switching\" src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/context_switching.jpg\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Updates: Documentation Context Switching\" /></a></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also improved styling of our error message content, troubleshooting content, and code examples.

you&#8217;ve probably heard by now, we are very excited to announce that the <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2014/06/30/general-availability/\">Bluemix platform is now officially available as a commercial offering.</a> As part of this announcement we&#8217;ve introduced new IBM and 3rd party services, updated our UI and docs and perhaps most importantly, introduced pricing.</p>\n<p>You can read all about that announcement on the <a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2014/06/30/general-availability/\">Bluemix blog</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to these platform changes, many of our services are going through changes as well, and some of these changes may require actions from you. Some examples of this include:</p>\n<ul>\n-Some beta services need to be replaced by their GA counterparts<br />\n-Some beta services require you to move the SDK or data to the GA version<br />\n-Certain services are being transitioned into new services</ul>\n<p>If no special instructions are included in this post, it means no action is needed from you at this time.</p>\n<p>If you are currently using the beta services require migrations, you will see both beta and GA versions at GA. Although you will not be able to create new instances using the beta version/obsolete services once we go GA. We are including a two week grace period for the migration and transition, and we will delete most beta services on July 15th. SQL database service will be deleted on July 30th. (Special instructions for database services are provided below).</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the entire list of impacted services and what you need to do if you are using these services today.</p>\n<p><b>Mobile Data</b></p>\n<p>You need to move to the GA version of the SDK. Here are two blog posts about the steps you need to take.<br />\n<a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2014/06/25/whats-new-mobile-cloud-june/\">/blogs/bluemix/2014/06/25/whats-new-mobile-cloud-june/</a><br />\n<a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/2014/06/25/migrating-mobile-cloud-client-applications-beta/\">/blogs/bluemix/2014/06/25/migrating-mobile-cloud-client-applications-beta/</a></p>\n<p><b>Mobile Quality Assurance </b></p>\n<p>The existing MQA beta is also coming to a conclusion. You can read more about the implications of this change and ask questions in our Q&amp;A on this topic: <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/15904/ibm-mobile-quality-assurance-open-beta-is-ending-soon/\">https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/15904/ibm-mobile-quality-assurance-open-beta-is-ending-soon/</a></p>\n<p><b>Single Sign On</b></p>\n<p>If you are using our existing SSO service, it will be migrating to a new service and configuration model. You will need to unbind your current instance and re-bind to the new one. You can find detailed instructions for how to make this change here: <a href=\"https://idaas.ng.bluemix.net/idaas/doc/sso_migration.jsp\">https://idaas.ng.bluemix.net/idaas/doc/sso_migration.jsp</a></p>\n<p><b>Monitoring and Analytics </b></p>\n<p>We have introduced new Log Analysis capabilities to the Monitoring and Analytics add-on in the Bluemix Beta. The Monitoring and Analytics add-on will replace the existing Log Analysis service you are using to manage Liberty and Node.js runtimes.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that the look and feel of this new Log Analysis solution will be different and you will need to re-create your current searches to take advantage of the new features.</p>\n<p><b>Required Actions</b></p>\n<ul>\n1. At this time, the Log Analysis service remains bound to your applications. It has been made private and cannot be bound to any new applications. The Monitoring and Analytics add-on with log analytics capabilities is now available in the Bluemix beta; please transition your runtimes to this add-on as soon as possible. Note that your runtimes cannot be bound to both the Log Analysis service and Monitoring and Analytics add-on at the same time.<br />\n2. On July 15th, only the Monitoring and Analytics add-on will be available in Bluemix. The existing Log Analysis service will be removed. At this point you have to bind your runtimes to the Monitoring and Analytics add-on if you have not already.<br />\n3. Follow the instructions below to bind to the new add-on</ul>\n<p>Instructions for switching from the current LogAnalysis service to the new Monitoring and Analytics:</p>\n<table style=\"width: 500px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Node.js Instructions</th>\n<th>Liberty Instructions</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unbind the LogAnalysis service from your application</td>\n<td>Unbind the LogAnalysis service from your application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Create an instance of the Monitoring andcAnalytics add-on</td>\n<td>Create an instance of the Monitoring andcAnalytics add-on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bind the Monitoring and Analytics add-on to your application</td>\n<td>Bind the Monitoring and Analytics add-on to your application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Install the Node.js-SCALA Data collector using the following command:<br />\n    npm install loganalysis</td>\n<td>Re-push your application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Add the following line of code in the start script of your Node.js application:<br />\n    require(&#8216;loganalysis&#8217;);</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Re-push your application</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><i>Other Information</i></p>\n<p>We are implementing this change to provide you with more capabilities to help better manage your development and operations efforts. Benefits of these changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n1. With a single add-on, you get both monitoring and log analysis capabilities to better detect and diagnose application problems</p>\n<p>2. Get more value out of your log analysis solution with the following additional capabilities:<br />\n· A consolidated view of the performance and availability of your applications based on monitoring metrics and logs.<br />\n· The ability to search and visualize log data with out of the box support for applications on Liberty and Node.js runtimes.</ul>\n<p>Please be aware that the look and feel of this new Log Analysis solution will be different and you will need to re-create your current searches to take advantage of the new features.</p>\n<p><b>Rules </b></p>\n<p>Rules is being upgraded to a new version. You will be required to unbind the current service instance and create a new one. Once the new instance is provisioned, you can bind this instance to your application and redeploy your rule Apps. You will need to update your Rule Execution Service Configuration in the Rule Designer IDE with the new Riles service endpoint and credentials. The Rules service will still be in beta.</p>\n<p><b>Cloud Integration and Cast Iron Live </b></p>\n<p>The Cloud Integration and Cast Iron tabs will now become one and the same. As all the work you have performed during the Beta stage resides on the Cast Iron servers, only one small change is needed at this time.</p>\n<p>To the support the workload entailed by transitioning from Beta to GA, we will be migrating all backend orchestrations to production level tenants. As a result, all secure connectors previously created will need to be recreated in the GA environment.</p>\n<p>Moving forward you will be able to use the &#8220;Create Integration&#8221; option from the Cloud Integration tile in order to log into either the Cast Iron live Evaluation or Production console.</p>\n<p><b>Analytics Warehouse (previously called Blu Acceleration)</b></p>\n<p>If you are a consumer of the BLUAcceleration service please note that a new, upgraded version of this service called Analytics Warehouse has been introduced. The beta version of the service has been discontinued and all existing instances of the BLUAcceleration service will be de-activated on July 15.</p>\n<p><i>Migration Instructions</i></p>\n<ul>\n-The service has been renamed &#8211; from BLU Acceleration to Analytics Warehouse<br />\n-The OpenBeta plan has been discontinued and a paid Small plan with a free-tier has been introduced<br />\n-To use the GA version of the service you will need to provision new instances of the Analytics Warehouse service<br />\n-Data and instances will not be automatically migrated from Beta to GA. Please load data into the GA instances directly.<br />\n-Extract any data you require from the beta instances of the service before July 15 as the beta instances will not be accessible thereafter<br />\n-Applications connecting to beta instances of the service will need to be unbound and bound to the GA instances<br />\n-Any new instances of the service you provision will have new database names, schema names, and user credentials, therefore be sure to update your applications with the new connection and schema information provided in the VCAP_services.</ul>\n<p>If you require any assistance in transitioning to the GA version of Analytics Warehouse service, you may post in the developer community or contact us at <a href=\"IM_Cloud_DevOps@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com \">IM_Cloud_DevOps@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com </a></p>\n<p><b>SQL Database</b></p>\n<p>As we move to GA the current SQLDB Open Beta program will come to an end. Existing SQLDB databases on the Open Beta program will be deactivated on July 15, 2014, and deleted 2 weeks later.</p>\n<p><i>Migration Instructions</i></p>\n<p>Old services instances will be discontinued, users need to create new service instances. So no unbind/rebind, but entirely new databases. Unfortunately there currently is no easy way for customers to export their data from databases of the existing open_beta plan. Users need to contact IBM if they want their data migrated. For simple cases users can use a sample program to export a table at a time, available in JazzHub here: <a href=\"https://hub.jazz.net/project/pvanrun/SQLDBCSVExport/overview\">https://hub.jazz.net/project/pvanrun/SQLDBCSVExport/overview</a> and then import into the new database using the CSV import in the SQLDB Console</p>\n<p><i>Additional Information</i></p>\n<p>There will be a GA SQL Database service with a Small Plan in the Bluemix catalog, which is comparable to the Open Beta service. We encourage you to try out this new SQL Database service. It allows for free databases up to 2GB in size with 1 GB of memory and a maximum of 20 connections per database. It also scales to support larger volumes, available for a monthly fee. For further details on the Small Plan and to get started see this link. We&#8217;re committed to making your transition easy, so please contact us with any questions regarding the new SQL Database at <a href=\"IM_Cloud_DevOps@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com\">IM_Cloud_DevOps@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com</a></p>\n<p><b>Cloudant NoSQL DB (previously called Cloudant JSONDB)</b></p>\n<p>As we move to GA the current Cloudant JSONDB Open Beta program will come to an end. The existing Cloudant JSONDB databases will continue to be accessed on Cloudant.com. There will be a GA Cloudant NoSQL Database service with a Shared Plan in the Bluemix catalog, which is comparable to the Open Beta service. We encourage you to try out this new Cloudant NoSQL Database service. It allows for free databases: up to 2 Gigabytes, no more that 10,000 Heavy API calls and no more than 50,000 Light API calls. It also scales to support larger volumes, available for a monthly fee. For further details on the Shared Plan and to get started see this link. We&#8217;re committed to making your transition easy, so please contact us with any questions regarding the new Cloudant NoSQL Database at <a href=\"IM_Cloud_DevOps@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com\">IM_Cloud_DevOps@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com</a></p>\n<p><b>Migration Instructions</b></p>\n<ul>\n-To use the GA version of the service you will need to provision new instances<br />\n-Data and instances will not be automatically migrated from Beta to GA. Please load data into the GA instances directly.<br />\n-Extract any data you require from the beta instances of the service from cloudant.com directly<br />\n-Applications connecting to beta instances of the service will need to be unbound and bound to the GA instances<br />\n-Any new instances of the service you provision will have new database names, schema names, and user credentials, therefore be sure to update your applications with the new connection and schema information provided in the VCAP_services.</ul>\n<p><b>Time Series Database</b></p>\n<p>As we move to GA the current Time Series Database Open Beta service will come to an end, and existing databases will be deactivated on July 15, 2014. Kindly extract any data you require from the beta instances of the service before July 15 as the beta instances will not be accessible thereafter. There will be a GA version of the Time Series Database service with a Small Plan in the Bluemix catalog, which is comparable to the Open Beta service.</p>\n<p><i>Migration Instructions</i></p>\n<p>Applications connecting to beta instances of the service will need to be unbound and bound to the GA instances.<br />\nAny new instances of the service you provision will have new database names, url, and user credentials, therefore be sure to update your applications with the information provided in the VCAP_SERVICES.</p>\n<p>If you require any assistance in transitioning to the GA version of TimeSeries Database service, you may post in the developer community or contact us at <a href=\"IM_Cloud_DevOps@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com\">IM_Cloud_DevOps@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com</a>.</p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2014/06/services-changes-bluemix-general-availability-2/","date":"2014-06-30T10:38:48","modified":"2016-12-07T16:36:51","format":"standard","slug":"services-changes-bluemix-general-availability-2","guid":"https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/?p=3441","excerpt":"<p>As you&#8217;ve probably heard by now, we are very excited to announce that the Bluemix platform is now officially available as a commercial offering.

This value is displayed next to your application ID in the Bluemix dashboard page for your application, or in  the MAS service configuration for your application.  You must pass value of the application secret to the initialize method of your mobile client application.  More details about the initialize method are in the Client SDK section.  Be sure to keep your application secret value confidential.  You can regenerate the secret from the Mobile Application Security service in your Bluemix dashboard.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Documentation</strong><br />The documentation URLs have changed.  If you bookmarked pages during the Beta, be aware that these pages might not be up to date.  You can find links to the updated documentation from the Bluemix dashboard.

These updates include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Addition of &#8220;Bring your Own Buildpack&#8221; to the catalog.</strong> Bluemix ships with a handful of <a title=\"built-in runtimes\" href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#overview/index.html#ov_buildpack\">built-in runtimes</a> (or &#8220;buildpacks&#8221;) for use in creating your apps. However, because Bluemix emphasizes openness, we&#8217;ve made the ability to build apps using external buildpacks front and center in our catalog. If you click the new &#8220;Bring your Own Buildpack&#8221; icon, you&#8217;ll see information and a link to more than a dozen <a title=\"community-created buildpacks\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks\">community-created buildpacks</a> known to be compatible with <a title=\"Cloud Foundry\" href=\"http://cloudfoundry.org\">Cloud Foundry</a>. This gives you an amazing amount of freedom in choosing the languages and tools most appropriate for your needs.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div id=\"attachment_2432\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bringYourOwnBuildpack.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bringYourOwnBuildpack-300x192.png\" alt=\"Bring Your Own Buildpack\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2432\" height=\"192\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bring Your Own Buildpack</p></div></div>\n<p><em>NOTE:</em> The ability to use custom buildpacks already existed by using <code>cf push</code> from the <a title=\"command line\" href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/BuildingWeb.html#install_cf\">command line</a>. This enhancement just makes that capability more apparent in the UI.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced navigation with collapsible navigation area.</strong> We wanted to help developers maximize use of screen real estate, so we&#8217;ve introduced the ability to collapse the Dashboard&#8217;s navigation area. This allows you to gain back some horizontal space if you want it. The screenshot below shows the &#8220;twisty&#8221; that allows you to open/close the nav area.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div id=\"attachment_2435\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayDashboardWithAnnotation.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayDashboardWithAnnotation-300x179.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Dashboard\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2435 \" height=\"179\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bluemix UI Dashboard</p></div></div>\n<p>The next screenshot shows the space gained by collapsing it.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2436\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayDashboardNavAreaCollapsed.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayDashboardNavAreaCollapsed-300x179.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Dashboard w/ Nav Area Collapsed\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2436 \" height=\"179\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bluemix UI Dashboard w/ Nav Area Collapsed</p></div>\n<p>Extra horizontal space is also helpful when working with <a title=\"services and add-ons\" href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/services.html\">services and add-ons</a> that provide configuration panels. For example, in the screenshot below, I&#8217;m configuring my instance of <a title=\"Cloud Integration\" href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/Services/CloudIntegration/CloudIntegration.html\">Cloud Integration</a> and additional space is useful.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div id=\"attachment_2470\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayUpdateExpandedAddon.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayUpdateExpandedAddon-300x127.png\" alt=\"Working with Add-on\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2470\" height=\"127\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Working with Add-on</p></div></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refreshed styling of banner, Dashboard header, App/Service Detail headers, and input dialogs.</strong> We continually iterate to try and present the information you need in the cleanest fashion we can. For example, we felt like the link to show the Notification Area was a little &#8220;hidden&#8221;, so now we&#8217;ve given it a place right on the banner for easy access.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_2468\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayUpdatesBannerWithNotificationPlushAnnotation.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayUpdatesBannerWithNotificationPlushAnnotation-300x124.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Banner Update w/ Notifications\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2468 \" height=\"124\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bluemix UI Banner Update w/ Notifications</p></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved handling of app-related data changes on the server.</strong> There are times when you are collaborating with other developers and they might make changes to apps you&#8217;re interested in. We&#8217;ve made the handling of such events more robust. To try this out, you can launch the Bluemix UI and then start or stop an app from the <a href=\"https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/BuildingWeb.html#install_cf\" title=\"command line\">command line</a>. For example, I went to the command line and stopped an app called <code>javaDemo</code> like so:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"><code>cf stop javaDemo</code></p>\n<p>Then, in the UI, I saw a notification that the running state of my <code>javaDemo</code> app changed. Now, the UI is in sync with the data on the server.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div id=\"attachment_2438\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayDashboardNotification.png\"><img src=\"/blogs/bluemix/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mayDashboardNotification-300x179.png\" alt=\"Bluemix UI Notification of App Stopped\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2438 \" height=\"179\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bluemix UI Notification of App Stopped</p></div></div>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Updated documentation.</strong> We&#8217;ve provided improved user assistance in the Bluemix UI and developer documentation for services.</li>\n<li><strong>Numerous usability improvements and bug fixes. </strong>This includes eliminating a number of &#8220;annoyances&#8221; like extra redirects taking place within the Bluemix UI during login.<strong><br /></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope you find the latest round of updates valuable.

The template code includes the Express module, which is preconfigured to host static files placed under the &#8220;/public&#8221; subdirectory of your application.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; The Node.js server SDK includes modules that facilitate local debugging of Node.js code.  It also includes a security module that can be used to selectively protect resource URIs and static files.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How to Migrate:</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; Make sure you have a copy of any existing Cloud Code modules and static files that are required for your application.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; After creating the Mobile Cloud application from the Mobile Cloud boilerplate, download the new application template code archive (from the Guide) to your local workstation and unpack it to a location of your choice.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; Enter &#8220;npm install &#8211;production&#8221; to bring down any prerequisite modules that are not already part of your node environment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; Place your static files into the ./public subdirectory of your application.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8211;
